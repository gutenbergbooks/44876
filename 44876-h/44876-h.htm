<h3>
CHAPTER I.
</h3>

<h4>
A HAIRBREADTH ESCAPE.
</h4>

<p>
I must either have been weaker, or the opiate
stronger than the doctor expected, for it was near
midnight before I awoke.  Although still very low
and faint, I felt much refreshed and invigorated.  For
some time I lay enjoying the coolness of the night
air, and listening to the chirping of the crickets, in
the crevices of the lofty roof.  There was not the
smallest noise besides to be heard in the house, and
every thing without was equally still.  At my
bedside, on the right hand, there stood a small
old-fashioned ebony table, inlaid with mother-of-pearl,
with several phials, a bottle of wine, and glasses on
it, an open book, the leaves kept down on one side by
a most enticing uncut pine-apple, and a large brown
wax candle, burning dimly in its tall massive silver
candlestick.  A chair of the same substance and
antique character, and richly carved, was set beside this
table, over the high perpendicular back of which hung
a seaman's jacket, and a black silk neckerchief, as if
the wearer had recently been reading beside me, and
very possibly watching me.  I listened&mdash;all continued
silent; and I turned, but still with great pain, towards
the open window or balcony that projected into and
overhung the neighbouring thoroughfare.  The
moonlight streamed through the casement, and, with a
sensation of ineffable pleasure, I gloated on the bright
stars beyond, deep set into the dark blue sky, while
the cool night breeze, charged with the odour of the
pine-apple, breathed gently, and oh! how passing
sweetly, on my feverish temples!
</p>

<p>
From the pain experienced in moving, I only turned
half-round, and therefore lay in a position that
prevented my seeing more than the upper part of the
large window; but I gradually slewed myself, so as
to lie more on my side.  "Heaven and earth, there
he is again!"  My heart fluttered and beat audibly.
My breathing became impeded and irregular, and large
drops of ice-cold perspiration burst from my forehead
and face; for <i>there</i>, with his head leaning on his hand,
his arm resting on the window sill, and motionless as
the timber on which he reclined, his beautiful features
upturned towards the pale cold moon, and full in the
stream of her mild effulgence, sat the apparition of
young Henry De Walden!  I tried to speak, but my
breath failed, and a sudden giddiness came over me.
"I am gone at last," thought I.  "I know what his
coming twice betokens&mdash;Henry, I will soon be with you!"
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
I had fainted away.  When I again opened my eyes,
I was so dizzy and confused, that I did not know
where I was.  My wound was giving me great pain,
and I turned with difficulty on my other side, towards
where the table stood.  Believing that I was fast
dying, and that I should soon be "a thing immortal as
itself," I did not even start when I saw the same
figure, whose appearance had so agitated me before,
now seated at the table, apparently reading.  "The
third time," thought I&mdash;"it should be so&mdash;it should
be so&mdash;Heaven receive my repentant soul!"
</p>

<p>
At this moment the door opened, and some one,
dressed like a seaman, slid into the room.  As he
approached the table, the apparition of the young
midshipman slowly lifted its head, and peered into the
darkness.  From the dimness of the taper it appeared
unable to make out what approached, for the ghost
now took up the snuffers, and snuffed the candle as
scientifically as if it had once inhabited the
tallow-tainted carcass of a scene-shifter.
</p>

<p>
"Confound these old-fashioned snuffers, the spring
is broken!"
</p>

<p>
My eyes opened at this, wider, I believe, than they
had ever done before, and my ears tingled.  "What
a speech from an inhabitant of the other world!"
thought I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh! is it you, Joe Peak?" quoth the handsome
spectre; "why do you steal in and startle one so,
you little villain?  Hush&mdash;off with these heavy shoes
of yours, and come and sit down, will ye?"
</p>

<p>
Master Joey, who, I knew, was in the body as yet
at any rate, now came forward into the light, and
drawing a chair, sat down fronting the apparition.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Henry, my lad, how is master Benjamin&mdash;better?"
</p>

<p>
"A good deal&mdash;if that old French medico has not
poisoned him outright with laudanum.  He has slept since
twelve at noon&mdash;and what's the hour now, Joey?"
</p>

<p>
"Gone eight bells&mdash;so go and turn in, De Walden,
and I will take my spell here."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, and so I will.  But here, take a glass
of vin-de-grave;" and, to my great wonderment, the
spectre and man of flesh hobbed and nobbed together
with all the comfort in life.  "Have you seen
Lennox this afternoon?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, I saw him about eight o'clock," said Peak;
"the alcalde has given up all the money that was
taken from"&mdash;here he nodded towards me&mdash;"when
he was stabbed by the raggamuffin he had fleeced."
</p>

<p>
"If ever I set foot within a gambling-house again,"
thought I,&mdash;but finding myself their topic, I lay still,
and listened attentively.
</p>

<p>
"How very extraordinary," continued Joey, "that
Lennox, on his way from Mr. M&mdash;&mdash;'s to the wharf,
should have stumbled on the little man, with the
ruffian in the very act of rifling him."
</p>

<p>
"Why, he did not rifle me," said I, faintly.  They
both started, and looked towards me.  "He did not
rob me, for I distinctly recollect his starting off when
he stabbed me."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, sir, that was to see if he had been sure in
his blow&mdash;for Lennox came on him after he returned,
just as he struck his stiletto into you the second time,
as you lay on the ground, and after having, with the
speed of thought, seized the <i>bolsa</i> with the doubloons."
</p>

<p>
"Wounded me twice!  Upon my honour," said I,
fumbling in my bosom, "and so he has&mdash;the villain."
</p>

<p>
Mr Peak continued&mdash;"From the marine's account,
he himself had a tough job of it, for if he had not got
hold of the knife, that had dropped during the scuffle,
<i>he</i> would have been done for, in place of having
<i>finished</i> the bravo."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Finished</i> the bravo!  Is the man who wounded
me dead, then?"
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, sir," continued Mr Peak.  "But he
cannot live, I hear&mdash;Lennox made sure work of it.
He told me himself, that in his desperation he passed
the knife into him, until his thumb was stopped by
his ribs&mdash;none of your back blows, but a straight
thrust&mdash;a regular pig-butcher's <i>slide</i>, sir."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Pig-butcher's slide!</i> how classical!  If he had
not deserved it," said I, "I would have been sorry
that a fellow-creature's blood had been shed even in
my defence."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," quoth De Walden, "it was, more properly
speaking, in Lennox's own defence; for the
villain, not content with killing you, as he thought he
had done, and robbing you besides, would most
assuredly have served the poor Scotchman the same way,
if he had not been beforehand with him."
</p>

<p>
"But where is Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"The town-guard, who had heard the row, came
up just as he had mastered his opponent, sir; and the
poor fellow, with great discretion, made no attempt
to escape, so he is now a prisoner, along with the
wounded man; but he is quite cool and collected, and
the moment you can give your evidence, there is not
the smallest doubt but he will be instantly released."
</p>

<p>
"And yourself, De Walden&mdash;by what miracle do
I see you here?"
</p>

<p>
"By next to a miracle, indeed, my dear sir," said
he, smiling; then, with an altered countenance, he
continued&mdash;"The worst among us, sir, is not yet a
fiend&mdash;no human heart is altogether evil&mdash;and I owe my
life to the very man who tried to take <i>yours</i>&mdash;to the
fellow who stabbed you, sir.  But I am forgetting
myself altogether&mdash;you must take your draught again,
sir, and to-morrow forenoon you shall know all.  In
the mean time I must entreat you to take some rest,
if you can, and I will go and turn in."
</p>

<p>
"I say, De Walden, what is that dropping there?"
</p>

<p>
"You are always making slops, Joe," said the other,
as he rose to go away; "why, what <i>have</i> you spilt
next?"
</p>

<p>
"Spilt?" rejoined Peak, "hand me the light, for,
by the powers, I believe that Mr Brail himself is
<i>spilling</i>,&mdash;if not quite entirely <i>spilt</i>&mdash;see here."
</p>

<p>
True enough; the wound in my breast, which,
although not deep, the knife having been stopped by
the bone, was lacerated, had burst out afresh, either
from my motion or <i>emotion</i>, and a black stream now
trickled over the sheet that covered the red-leather
mattrass of the quatre on which I rested, and fell
tap-tap on the floor.
</p>

<p>
"Run, run, De Walden&mdash;call the doctor's assistant&mdash;he
sleeps in the next room," cried little Peak.
</p>

<p>
In a moment the Spaniard was with us, without
his clothes, but <i>with</i> his bandages and lint, and as the
operation was a very simple one, I was soon put to
rights again; but I took the hint, and asked for no
more information that night.  De Walden now rose
and wished me good-night, saying, as little Peak took
charge of the deck, "You are to call Mrs Gerard at
daylight, Joey&mdash;so clap a stopper on your jaw, you
little villain, and don't speak one word, <i>even if he
desires you</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Pah, you be hanged, De Walden," quoth Joey.
</p>

<p>
So, satisfied and thankful for what I now did know,
and in the hope of learning <i>all</i> to-morrow, I took the
draught, turned on my sound side, and slept in Elysium.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
Next morning, when I awoke, the sun had already
risen, and shone cheerily through the open casement.
Several black female domestics were busy setting the
room in which I lay in order, and a middle-aged
respectable-looking white woman employed in sewing,
now occupied the chair in which the ghost of De
Walden sat the previous night, while busied in the
etherial occupation of eating pine-apple and drinking
vin-de-grave.
</p>

<p>
Seeing I was awake, she spoke&mdash;"I hope you feel
yourself better this morning; you have had a very
quiet night, sir, Mr Peak says."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, I do feel wonderfully refreshed.  Pray,
are you one of the family?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir, I am the wife of the captain of the
American brig, whose crew you, and your friend Mr
Lanyard, saved from perishing of thirst."
</p>

<p>
"What! are you the poor woman whom I found
in the cabin with her child?"
</p>

<p>
"I am, sir; and I hope heaven will reward you for
it.  My husband has been here often, sir, to enquire
after you.  His vessel is consigned to Mr Duquesné,
sir; how happy he will be to find you so much better,
when he calls at dinner time to-day!"
</p>

<p>
"How came it that I was carried into this house?
Mr Duquesné's, I believe&mdash;a Frenchman, from the
name?"
</p>

<p>
"You were wounded close to it, sir, and the marine
who found you, thinking you were dying, requested
the guard, after they had taken the man who stabbed
you, to allow you to be carried in here; and I thank
Heaven that you have fallen into such good hands,
and that I have had it in my power to be of some use
to you, as a sick-nurse."
</p>

<p>
To let the reader behind the curtain without more
palaver, I shall bring my log up to the present
speaking, in three words or so:&mdash;Mr Duquesné, in whose
hospitable mansion I now lay badly wounded, was a
French merchant of high repute in Havanna.  He
was a widower, and had an only daughter, Sophie, the
beautiful brunette that I had seen hanging over De
Walden at the easel.  The manager of his New York
establishment, an American gentleman of the name
of Hudson, whose son was a lieutenant in the Yankee
frigate anchored in the port, was at this time, with
his wife and daughter, on a visit to him, having come
down in the man-of-war.  Mr Hudson had a twofold
object in this visit; first, to arrange some mercantile
transactions with his partner; and secondly, to take
possession of a large coffee property, that he had lately
inherited in right of his wife.
</p>

<p>
Sophie Duquesné and Helen Hudson were bosom
friends, according to the rule observed in all similar
cases; and as for the gentlemen of the family, Mr
Duquesné, the papa, was a stout but very handsome
man, apparently about fifty.  He did not, in the most
remote degree, fall in with one's notions of a
Frenchman; verily I would have sworn he never had eaten
a frog in his life.  He was punctiliously well-bred,
spoke English tolerably, and Spanish perfectly well;
and, under Providence, I have to thank him that I
am now inditing this authentic record.  Had I been
his own son, he could not have had me more tenderly
cared for.  Mr Hudson was a tall, sallow person, with
a good dash of the Yankee in his outward man, and a
little flavour of the same in his accent and phraseology;
but an upright merchant, well read in the literature
of the day, a tolerable linguist, and more liberal
in his opinions than most of his countrymen.  He had
travelled a good deal on the Continent, and had spent
three years in England, partly for his wife's health,
and partly for the education of his only daughter,
Helen.  But his wife was, without exception, one
of the most ladylike persons I ever beheld.  She was
an heiress of one of the best families in Philadelphia,
and in her youth had been a beauty; even now she
was an exceedingly fine woman, very tall, with fine
dark hair and eyes, and a most delicate complexion.
Her smile was absolutely irresistible.
</p>

<p>
"But, Master Benjie, let us have a small view of
Miss Helen Hudson, whom you have taken so much
pains <i>not</i> to describe."
</p>

<p>
"All in good time, <i>mon ami</i>&mdash;all in good time;
but here comes De Walden."
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Mr Brail; you seem much better.
Mrs Hudson has Dr Delaville's permission to
offer you some coffee and toast this morning."
</p>

<p>
"Well, do you know, I think I could eat it."
</p>

<p>
Breakfast was accordingly brought, and I made a
deuced good one.  Excellent coffee, bread most
beautiful, all the concomitants delicate in the extreme;
even the cool water in the small porous earthen jar,
that flanked a magnificent red snapper, was an
unspeakable luxury.  The very privilege of grasping
the dewy neck of the little vessel, in the act of
helping yourself, was worth a Jew's eye.
</p>

<p>
"So, Master De Walden, shake hands, will ye,
that I may be certain you are really flesh and blood;
and tell me how came it that you were not drowned,
my lad, when you fell overboard on the bar?"
</p>

<p>
"The only way that I can account for it, my dear
sir," said the handsome young fellow, laughing, "is,
that I suppose I am fated to a drier death."
</p>

<p>
"I would not hear thine enemy say so," quoth I.
</p>

<p>
"However, my tale is easily told:&mdash;You remember,
sir, that I was standing close beside you, when
you were jamming the Spanish schooner on the
reef?"&mdash;I nodded&mdash;"I got a regular souse, and
must have sank some way, but I never lost my
recollection.  When I rose amidst the breakers on the
bar, I found myself in the very thick of the wreck of
the schooner, and, close to me, five poor devils
clinging to her mainboom, with the sea breaking over
them every moment.  One of them presently parted
company and disappeared; and finding that the spar
was anchored by the topping-lifts and boomsheet to
the hull of the vessel that had swamped, part of
which as yet held together, I left it, and struck put
for a large piece of wreck, apparently several deck
planks, kept together by part of two beams, when the
deck had blown up.  I reached it, and found two
men already on it,&mdash;one of them a Spaniard, the
other an Englishman, as he instantly addressed me
in English, in answer to some sudden exclamation of
mine, on first clambering on to the planks.  My
surprise at this was great, and so was his, I make no
doubt; but the unruly surge was more surprising
than all, for another sea rolled over us, and the
Spaniard alone remained.  The next moment I saw my
countryman struggling in the water close to me, but
so weak that it was clear he must instantly sink if
not succoured.  As I looked, a piece of a sweep,
belonging to the schooner, surged against me, and
nearly drove me off my perch; I caught it, and
shoving the blade to the drowning man, with some
danger of being unroosted myself in the attempt, it
reached him: he held on, and I got him once more on
the planks.  He was a gruff savage, however, and
scarcely seemed to relish my saving him at all at first.  He
had been stunned, forsooth, by a blow on the head
from a piece of floating wreck when he sank, or he
could <i>easily</i> have resumed his place on the spar again
without my assistance; and I daresay he said true,
only I did not much admire his manners in the
declaration, all things considered: indeed, I soon perceived
that his physical endurance and bodily strength were
greatly superior to mine.  Both of us saw&mdash;as for
the third of the trio, he appeared almost dead from
fatigue or fear, and we could get no assistance from
him either by advice or labour&mdash;that unless we could
get the piece of the wreck we clung to out of the
broken water, we must inevitably be washed off and
perish.  With one accord, we therefore contrived to
hold up the blade of the sweep, so as to expose the
flat of it to the land-wind, and in a few minutes we
had the inexpressible delight to find that we had slid
into smooth water.  Cold comfort, you will say, to
find ourselves drifting out to sea, on so frail a
conveyance; but the escape from immediate and impending
death made one of us at least most thankful to
Heaven for the chance of escape, however slender, thus
presented to us; although my judgment told me at
the same time, that it would prove, in all human
likelihood, nothing more than a reprieve, and that
none of the longest.  When the day broke, the
breeze, as you may remember, shifted and blew on
shore again, where, by the aid of the sweep blade
once more, we landed about noon, faint from hunger
and thirst, I don't know which was most violent, and
fatigue.  The seaman I had saved was a large and
exceedingly powerful man, with immense whiskers, and
his strong but very handsome features bronzed almost
black by the sun.  His limbs were beautifully
moulded, and he had the chest and neck of a Hercules:
both he and the other poor creature, who came
ashore more dead than alive, were dressed in white
trowsers, and shirts made of some blue cotton stuff,
and wore the long Spanish knife, stuck through red
silk sashes.  'What is to be done now?' said I to
my new friend; but he by this time had got his wits
about him, and pretended that he did not understand
me, confining himself to Spanish in his reply.  'Now,
that won't do, my good sir,' I said; 'you spoke as
good English on these planks there as I do, and you
understood me well enough when I called to you to
lay hold of the blade of the sweep, when'&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'I was drowning, you would say, young gentleman,'
interjected he of the sash and stiletto.  'It is
very true I am an Englishman, and you will find me
not ungrateful, although, Heaven knows, the life you
have preserved is no boon to'&mdash;&mdash;He checked himself,
and proceeded&mdash;'But it is lucky for you that
you have made a friend of me, for otherwise,
although you have escaped the perils of the sea, you
could not have eschewed the certain death that would
now await you, from those you must mingle with,
were it not that I am here to ward it off.'
</p>

<p>
"And time it was, indeed, for him to make some
demonstration in my behalf; for the half-drowned
devil, that we had been the means of saving between
us, by getting the piece of wreck to shore, now began,
like a wasp that you have picked out of a honeypot,
to revive and whet his sting, and to fumble with
his long knife, looking at me all the while very
ominously.  My protector, noticing that I shrunk
behind him, for I was altogether unarmed,
immediately said something sternly to his companion in
Spanish; and the other continuing to grumble, he
made a sudden snatch at his knife, and cast it from
him as far as he could into the sea.
</p>

<p>
"'Now, young gentleman,' said my preserver,
'I don't care who you are, although I conceive I am
not wrong in surmising you to be a midshipman of
that infernal felucca that has been the cause of
ruining me and my hopes; but, notwithstanding, if I can
help it, you shall come to no harm; so lend a hand,
let us have a search for water&mdash;there must be some
hereabout in the crevices of the rocks above
high-water mark, brackish though it may be&mdash;and I will
try to pick up some sea-birds' egg's.  Antonio!'
shouted he, in a voice of authority, to the other man
who had hung astern, 'venga el fuego.'
</p>

<p>
"By this time he had several pieces of driftwood
in his hand, and having secured the flint and steel
which the Spaniard had in a small bag, that he
carried at his waist for lighting his cigar, by jerking
them forcibly away, he put them in his pocket; and
the comely personage who had taken a fancy to scour
his steel in my brisket, and I, separated to look for
water.  It was not long before I succeeded, and
setting up a shout, my two allies were soon beside me.
The Englishman, having first soaked it in fresh
water, now spread the tinder on the rock, where the
hot sun instantly dried it.  He then struck a light,
and taking half-a-dozen wild sea-fowls' eggs out of
the net-bag that he usually wore his hair in, we
roasted them, and found them deucedly fishy, but
palatable enough, under the circumstances; and having
drank of the water in the crevice, we immediately
proceeded, much refreshed, towards the bank of the river,
where I had so unceremoniously parted company the
previous night.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot tell with what bitterness of heart I
turned as we left the beach, and, shading my eyes
with my hand from the intolerable glare of the
glass-like sea, beheld the felucca and frigate communicating
in the offing.  I felt like a criminal under sentence
of death, and the time of execution close at hand.
But I had no alternative.  Escape was utterly
impracticable; and, therefore, making a merit of
necessity, I endeavoured to assume an air of confidence
in my fierce-looking guide, although, Heaven knows,
I was inwardly shrinking from him with instinctive
abhorrence.
</p>

<p>
"When we arrived at the shore of the river, we
found a group of five negroes, who were apparently
watching the motions of the vessels out at sea.  They
and my conductors communed together in bad Spanish
for a minute.  I could not well make out what they said,
hut it evidently related to some more of the
schooner's crew having been saved, and presently we did
see three miserable half-drowned-looking creatures
shove out from beyond a small headland of the river
above us, in a canoe, and paddle into the stream, with
an intention, apparently, of crossing to the other side;
but the tide was by this time too strong for them,
weak as they were, and was setting them fast down
on the bar.
</p>

<p>
"My English companion, seeing them in doubt
whether to put about or push across, hailed.  This
made them lie on their paddles to reconnoitre us.
They seemed instantly to make him out, and, with a
shout of recognition, they pulled as rapidly as their
exhausted state would let them towards us, until
they floated in the dead water under the bank, within
pistol-shot.  But the sight of me seemed to stagger
them a bit.
</p>

<p>
"'Quien es, quien es el muchacho?'&mdash;(Who is
he&mdash;who is the youngster?)&mdash;said one of them.
</p>

<p>
"'One of the crew of the felucca, that fell
overboard when the schooner went to pieces on the bar.'
</p>

<p>
"'But are you sure there are no more of the
English villains on shore, captain?'
</p>

<p>
"'Quite certain&mdash;not one;&mdash;so approach, will ye,
and take us off?'&mdash;But they still hung in the wind,
until my protector, losing temper, sung out, with a
ferocity in his tone and manner that made me start,
'You cowardly hounds&mdash;you beasts&mdash;what do you
fear?  You see the coast is clear&mdash;that there is no
one near us.  One <i>cuchilado</i> [blow with a knife],
and the boy is dead at my feet.'  Still they seemed
irresolute, and, finding it bad policy to threaten men
he could not reach, he tried the other tack, and
turned to the man beside us.  'Speak, Pedro, and tell
them I say true.'
</p>

<p>
"The man, who had as much reason to dread
being left alone on the shore as we had, instantly did
so, and with better success, for presently they took
us on board, when with our aid the canoe was safely
paddled across, and subsequently up the river; so
that, by the time the night fell, we were again at
the ruins of the house that had been burned in the
attack, and abreast of the polacre brig, lying sunk
where we had left her.
</p>

<p>
"I shall remember until my dying day the fierce
looks of the survivors of the polacre's crew, whom we
found employed in getting up a temporary roof of
palm branches over a corner of the ruined building,
when they saw me, and learned who I was.  I began
to think that it was by no means certain that the
person who had promised me protection would be
able to keep his word.
</p>

<p>
"As the night fell, a large fire was lit in the
centre of the open space where the fetish temple
stood, soon after which several negroes and three
white Spaniards joined us.  I soon gathered from
their conversation that they belonged to a large
slaver that lay farther up, and having heard the firing
on the previous day, they had descended as scouts to
ascertain the cause; but seeing the polacre sunk in
the stream, and the conflagration on the opposite
bank to where they were, they had waited until now
before venturing across, and until they had been
assured by a native canoe that the British force was
entirely out of the river.
</p>

<p>
"Information as to their intentions was every thing
to me, so I determined to conceal my knowledge of
Spanish, slight though it might be; and as I looked
round the circle of white desperadoes and black
savages, on whom the large fire cast a bright but
flickering glare, that made their bodily proportions and
wild features flit and glimmer, as if they had been a
dream of gibbering demons, I endeavoured to appear
calm and collected, and to avoid fixing my eyes on
the speaker, whoever he might be, although, God he
knows, with what breathless and palpitating eagerness
I drank in every word I could make out, while my
alarm fearfully construed many that I did not understand.
</p>

<p>
"By this time it was quite dark, and my new
associates having made a full meal on goat's flesh and
yams, a large jar of Spanish brandy was produced,
and each man had a portion served to him by one of
the black fellows, who walked round the circle with a
small drinking cup, hollowed out of a gourd, or
calabash, followed by another dingy, more than half-naked
devil, carrying a larger vessel of the same kind, full
of abominably bad water.
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman now stood up in the centre.
</p>

<p>
"'Jose Ribas,' said he, in a steady determined tone,
gracefully yet firmly poising himself on his right leg,
and stretching out his right arm, while his left hand
rested easily on his hip, as he addressed a very
handsome young Spaniard, who sat on the ground nearly
opposite to me, 'you know, and all here know, that to
give you a chance of weighing the polacre, as well as
to revenge your injuries, and the loss of your
comrades, I attacked the felucca, and in consequence was
lost on the bar.'&mdash;He paused.&mdash;'Yes, you see the
whole surviving crew of the Santa Anna before you
in these four men and myself; and you need not be
told, that in consequence of the wreck of my schooner,
I am a ruined man&mdash;don't force me to become a
<i>desperate</i> one.  You are now, Jose Ribas, commanding-officer
of the Maria, in consequence of poor Isidoro
Ladron's death, and you also know that you have not
hands left of your own to run her out to Havanna.
Now, I will join you with my people here, on one
condition.'
</p>

<p>
"'You must join us on any condition,' grumbled
several of the white Spaniards.  'We shall not go to
sea with Jose Ribas as our captain, unless you are with
us.  He is <i>uno muchacho</i> [a mere boy]; so name
your condition, captain; he <i>must</i> and shall subscribe
to it at once.'
</p>

<p>
"'Then it is simply this&mdash;this young Englishman,
saved my life when I was sinking&mdash;ay, after he had
fallen overboard from his own vessel, and had nothing
between himself and death but the plank he clung to.
He saved <i>my life!</i>&mdash;You know, since the coast now
swarms with enemies, that you will need <i>my help</i>&mdash;you
know it.'
</p>

<p>
"'Si, si&mdash;es cierto, cierto.'
</p>

<p>
"'Then this young Englishman must neither be
injured nor left amongst the savages here.  He <i>must</i> go
with us.'&mdash;(Here some of the ruffians made very
unequivocal demonstrations).&mdash;'Ay, you may threaten,
but <i>it is</i> the price of my services.'
</p>

<p>
"Suddenly they all appeared to acquiesce.
</p>

<p>
"'So here, give me another knife.'&mdash;He crossed
them&mdash;(Hamlet, thought I)&mdash;'Swear by the blessed
Mary, the patroness of your polacre, that it shall not
be your fault if he be not safely landed at Havanna.'
</p>

<p>
"'But he will inform on us to the comissionados
[commissioners] at Havanna, when we get there.'
</p>

<p>
"'He will not,' rejoined he fiercely,&mdash;'<i>He shall
not</i>.'  Then turning to me&mdash;'Young gentleman, bear
me out; your life depends on it.  Promise you will
in no way bring them into trouble if you can help it.'
</p>

<p>
"I did so.
</p>

<p>
"'<i>There</i>, he promises, and I will be answerable
for him that he keeps his word&mdash;so swear.'
</p>

<p>
"They took the oath, and each one of the white
Spaniards, the survivors of the two crews, now
reduced to twenty-three, shook hands with me, and kissed
the crossed blades, and from that moment we were as
cordial as pickpockets.
</p>

<p>
"Shortly after we all lay down to sleep, with the
exception of one of our party, who stood sentry until
relieved by another.
</p>

<p>
"About twelve at night, when I awoke, the fire
had sunk to a mass of glowing embers in the centre
of a circle of white ashes, rayed with charred branches;
and the moon was shining clear and bright overhead,
and sparkling in the clustered dewdrops that
hung thickly on the laurel-like bushes around us, as
they were shaken from the overhanging trees in
showers of diamonds, at every swell of the passing
night-wind.
</p>

<p>
"The buzz and murmur, indescribable to one who
has never heard it, of the myriads of living things,
crickets, and lizards, and insects, and night-flies, of
innumerable varieties, blended with the moaning of
the river, as it rushed in the distance; while the
loud croak of the tree-toad, and the whistle of a large
lizard, would for a moment gush out from the lulling
monotony, clear and distinct, like a louder night-cry
above the declining hum of a distant city.
</p>

<p>
"There was something touchingly melancholy in
the aspect of nature, thus lying in a trance; and as I
gazed on the ferocious brigands that lay around me,
the mild light floating over their brawny and
half-naked figures, and glancing on their knives and arms,
and perceived that they all slept gently, as so many
inoffensive and innocent children, could I forget they
were men like myself?
</p>

<p>
"But there was one there who <i>did not</i> sleep&mdash;it
was the Englishman who had taken me under his
protection.  He was sitting about three fathoms apart
from the men, under the shadow of a wild tamarind-tree,
whose small elegant leaves, shaped like those of
the sensitive plant, were not sufficient to prevent the
moonlight struggling through them, and falling in
flickering beams on his face, which I could notice he
turned upwards towards heaven.  His lips moved,
and he withdrew one of his hands on which he had
leant, as he sat on the ground, and clasped both on his
bosom; and several bright drops chased each other across
his face, but whether they were dew-spangles, that the
breeze had shaken from the tree above, or tears of
repentance for a misspent life, can only now be known
to that Almighty Being who searcheth the heart.
Hush! he has knelt.  Is he praying?  For a minute
his attitude was one of deep devotion: his hands were
clasped under his chin, and his head was bent towards
the ground.  Presently he clasped both hands on the
crown of his head, and bent forward as if there had
been a weight crushing his temples to the earth.  I
could see his chest heave, and heard him sob audibly;
and two of my senses must have deceived me, or I
now heard several large tears drop with a small
patter, amongst the withered leaves, and sparkle as they
fell in the pure moonlight.  Anon a wreath of white
mist floated up from the river, and obscured the moon.
The noxious exhalation was like to suffocate us, as
it gradually settled down so thick, that every thing
seemed magnified and dim as when seen through a
winter's fog in England.  'Ay,' said he bitterly, as he
raised his head, and dropped his hands by his side,
'we have had none of the fen-damp the whole night,
until this moment; but what other answer to my
prayers could <i>I</i> look for?'
</p>

<p>
"One of the men here awoke.  He started like a
guilty thing, and drawing his large cloak over his
shoulders, cast a rapid and suspicious glance around
him, and lay down once more&mdash;whether to sleep or
not, I cannot tell.
</p>

<p>
"The day at length broke, the sea-breeze set in, the
sun shone cheerily, even on that dreary river's brink,
and rolled off the heavy fog that had overlaid us
like a damp cold shroud in the night, and all was bustle
again.
</p>

<p>
"Another slaver came down the river this forenoon.
Her water-casks were instantly had on deck,
and bunged tightly, and at low water stowed away in
the stranded polacre's hold, and secured just under the
beams, along with the whole of her own, similarly
prepared; so that when the next tide made, and flowed
into her, she floated, and was towed by the boats of
both vessels into one of the numberless muddy creeks,
that opened like so many dirty lanes from the river on
each side; at the ebb, she was hove down by the stems
of two large trees, and careened.  It was found that
the shot fired into the hold, which had sunk her, had
only damaged two planks of the garboard streak.
These were soon removed, and substantially replaced;
and within a week she was again at anchor in the
river, with wood, water, and provisions on board, and
once more all as ready, as if nothing had happened, to
receive her cargo of slaves.
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman, during the whole of this
period, was the prime mover.  His energy and skill
astonished me; and I was often surprised how the
Spaniards submitted to his reckless, nay, savage way
of knocking them about; but a look was always
sufficient to check their grumblings.  At length, every
thing being ready for a start, the slaves were taken on
board, and secured&mdash;and both vessels, the brig that
had assisted us, and the polacre, dropped down to
within two miles of the bar, ready for sea.
</p>

<p>
"I confess I did not perceive so much suffering
among the poor kidnapped savages as I expected.
Few of them seemed to regret leaving Africa; in
fact, the bitterness of parting from home and friends
had long been over with most of them, as none were
natives of the coast; and as they had been badly lodged,
and worse fed, on shore, with the agreeable variety of
being decimated every now and then as a sacrifice to
the fetish, the comparative improvement of their
condition on board&mdash;so far as the supply of their
animal wants, and a sound sleep, went, even although
the last was taken in a crowded hold, savouring of
any thing but otto of roses&mdash;seemed to render them
much more joyous than I had ever seen them while
cooped up in the depots on the river's banks.  It is
true, that in consequence of our attack, the cargo was
by no means so large as it would otherwise have been,
so the poor creatures had more room.
</p>

<p>
"We sailed, and kept well away to the southward,
for two reasons; first, to steer clear of you, and,
secondly, to fall in with the breeze, which is stronger
at this season of the year in that direction than more
northerly.  In both objects we succeeded, for we
arrived here a week before you, and must therefore
have escaped the calms and light winds that baffled you.
</p>

<p>
"We fell in with several vessels on the voyage, all
of which we outsailed but one.  It was an English
eighteen-gun brig, that beat us fairly going free,
and kept way so well with us on a wind, that the
captain beat to quarters, piped the hammocks up,
triced up the boarding nettings, and saw all clear for
action.  He had continued very kind to me throughout
the voyage, giving me a cot in his own cabin;
but he was, notwithstanding, morose and melancholy,
seldom mixing much even with his own officers; on
the occasion of our being chased, however, his eye
lightened, his brow smoothed and expanded, and his
whole features expressed a joy, mixed with the
sternest determination, that I had never seen them wear
before.  And this increased as our chance of escape
diminished; for when he finally saw that the sloop
was forereaching on us, and most probably would
weather us next tack, he became absolutely frantic
with delight, and walked rapidly about the deck,
laughing and rubbing his hands, to the unutterable
surprise of the trembling crew, who were grouped at
quarters, staring one moment in fear and dread at the
enemy, who was jamming them up in the wind, and
the next at their extraordinary captain.
</p>

<p>
"'What can he mean?' said they&mdash;'<i>he</i> will be
hanged if we are taken&mdash;<i>he</i> runs more risk than we
do&mdash;what cause of joy can <i>he</i> have?'  No one could
answer the question.
</p>

<p>
"The Englishman had trained, as carefully and
fully as time would admit during the voyage, about
fifty Corromantee negroes, the bravest race of all
Central Africa, to the guns, and he now suddenly
desired them to be piped on deck, and sent to
quarters.  Jose Ribas, the superseded mate of the
polacre, demurred to this, and the grumbling amongst
the crew increased.  'Why bring the negroes on
deck, captain?' said he&mdash;'our game is to confine our
endeavours to trying to escape, and not to fight; you
must be aware, if it comes to blows, that we have no
chance with that English sloop of war down to
leeward there.'
</p>

<p>
"The man he spoke to, at this turned round on
him with the most withering and hellish expression
of countenance that I ever beheld.  'I did not <i>ask</i> to
command this polacre&mdash;you know I did not&mdash;but now
since I have taken that unsought-for task upon me, it is
not in a moment like the present that I will resign it.'
</p>

<p>
"There was a pause, during which the captain had
turned from the Spaniard, and resumed his walk on
the quarterdeck.  As he turned, seeing him still there,
he walked close up to him, and made a dead stop.
</p>

<p>
"'Forward to your station, Jose Ribas,' he sung
out loud and savagely, after having glared at him like
an enraged tiger, for nearly a minute without speaking,
and drawing a pistol from his belt, he cocked it,
'or, by the God that made me, I will send this
bullet through your cowardly heart.'
</p>

<p>
"The man slunk away forward, holding up the
palm of his hand to the side of his face, as if,
expecting to be fired at, he had thought he might thereby
ward off the bullet.  I saw that the fiend within him
was only now roused, although the demoniacal mirth,
formerly exhibited, had given way to a stern
composure, that seemed to awe the rough and boisterous
crew over which he held control, into the most
abject submission.  They immediately got the trained
slaves on deck, and there were the piebald groups,
half-clad whites, and entirely naked blacks, clustered
round the guns, more frightened apparently for their
captain than the enemy down to leeward.  The
polacre carried two long twelves and ten eighteen-pound
medium guns, a description of cannon between a
carronade and long gun, much in use amongst the
contraband slavers; but she was pierced for twenty.  Both
vessels were on the starboard tack, so it was the
larboard guns that in the present instance were cast
loose.  After the captain had carefully taken the
bearings of the brig, by a compass that he had placed
on the capstan, he made one or two quick turns fore
and aft on the weather side of the quarterdeck, with
his hand behind his back, and his eyes fixed on the
planks, as if he were finally making up his mind what
course to pursue.
</p>

<p>
"'The brig has hoisted an English ensign and
pennant, sir,' said one of the crew.  He took no
notice of the man, who immediately slunk away to
his gun again.
</p>

<p>
"'Are the guns double-shotted?' at length said
he, without discontinuing his walk, or raising his head.
</p>

<p>
"'No,' said Jose Ribas.
</p>

<p>
"'Then double-shot them instantly.'  It was
done.  'Now, get the two long twelves aft, and train
them through the stern chase ports,&mdash;stand by to
lower away the boat; and get two of the larboard guns
over to windward, do you hear?'  This order was
promptly carried into effect, although the battery
next the enemy was thus disarmed of three cannon,
to the surprise and great dismay of the Spaniards, who
did not seem to know what to make of his tactics,
and, privateer fashion, began again to grumble in
their gizzards.  'Silence, men;&mdash;secure the guns to
leeward there, and man the starboard broadside, do you
hear&mdash;quick.'  In an instant the grumbling ceased,
and the command was obeyed.  'Boatswain, call
away the sail trimmers, and see all clear to let go
every thing by the run, when I give the word to
shorten sail.'
</p>

<p>
"By this time a squall was roughening the sea to
windward, and presently white crests began to break
amidst the dark water.  He jumped on a gun carriage,
and took a long steady look in the quarter from
whence he seemed to expect the wind to come,
shading his eyes from the sun with his hand.  The sloop
at this moment fired at us, and every hand on deck
but himself looked out anxiously to see where the
shot dropped.  He never moved.  Another puff of
white smoke from the brig, and this time the bullet
struck the water close under our martingale, and
ricochetted along the sea across our bows.  Seeing
we were within range, the sloop of war now let fly
her whole broadside; and presently several ropes that
had been taught enough before, were streaming out
like pennants, but no serious damage was sustained.
</p>

<p>
"We were, if any thing, lying closer to the wind
than our antagonist, but she was going faster through
the water, and had forereached on us so far as to
be well before our beam by this time.  The squall
was now very near us, and neither vessel had as yet
taken in a rag, but it was evident that we must soon
shorten sail, as we were lying over so as to bury
our lee guns in the water, and both vessels were
thrashing and tearing through it like smoke, the
water flashing up as high as the foretop of the brig,
and roaring at our bows like hoarse thunder.
</p>

<p>
"The captain was still standing on the gun, one
moment looking at the weather, the next casting his
eyes upwards, to see how the spars stood the strain,
and now, at the very moment when the strength of the
squall struck us, he jumped down, seized the helm,
and jammed it hard to windward.  'Ease off the lee
braces&mdash;round in the weather ones,' pealed through his
trumpet.  'That will do&mdash;let go nothing&mdash;keep all
fast!'  The masts were bending forward like willow
wands&mdash;the back-stays like iron rods.  I expected to
see the lighter sails fly out of the bolt-ropes every
moment, if indeed the masts did not go over the side.
</p>

<p>
"The squall was now so thick, that we could not
see our antagonist; but I noticed that the captain
had carefully kept his eyes on her, so long as he could
distinguish her, and glanced earnestly at the compass
when she disappeared amidst the thick weather.  We
had now bore up dead before the wind, and were
running, so far as I could judge, directly for the brig.
</p>

<p>
"In another minute, we dimly discovered, first the
stern and aftersails of our antagonist, and then the
whole hull, in the very thickest of the squall, but
scarcely visible amongst the white spray and drift.
She was now under her reefed topsails and courses,
but still on the same tack.  We flew down towards
her like lightning, hands by the topgallant and topsail
halyards, with an intention apparently of shaving her
stern.  'Surely these brigands won't have the
audacity to rake her,' said I to myself, 'seeing she can
beat them going free.'  As we approached, the brig,
foreseeing our intention, kept off the wind also; but
we were too quick for her, and were now, as she was
in the very act of wearing, within the chuck of a
biscuit of her tafferel.  By this manoeuvre, it will be
seen that our strongest broadside, viz. the starboard
one, was now opposed to the enemy.  'Fire!' sung
out the captain, in a voice that made me start again.
Heaven have mercy on me!  I could hear the shot
smash, and rattle, and tear along the sloop's deck, and
through her hull, but nothing came down as she wore
round.  The squall now came thundering upon us
at its height.  'Let go all the halyards by the run,'
was the next word, and down came every sail in the
polacre on deck, leaving nothing for the gale to
impinge on but the naked masts and hull, as from her
rig she had neither tops nor top-hamper of any kind.
By this time the brig was also before the wind, and busy
clewing up and furling every thing but her foresail;
but the fury of the squall struck her before the
foretopsail could be got in, and, crash, the topmast went
close by the cap.  'Bring the polacre to the wind now,
my lads.  Helm a-starboard, Jose Ribas&mdash;that's it.
Set the trysail there&mdash;hoist&mdash;so, belay every inch;' and
by this manoeuvre the polacre was in a minute hove to
on the larboard tack, in which position the word was
given to lower away the boat over the stern, in order
to unmask the sternchasers; but something
jammed&mdash;'Unhook her and let her go,'&mdash;neither could this
be done&mdash;'then cut the tackles, and let her drop
from the davits at once, you lubbers.'  The boat fell
into the water with a splash, and the polacre instantly
began to blaze away, from her two long guns, at the
brig, by this time half-a-mile to leeward, repairing
damages.  The weather now cleared as suddenly as it
had thickened when the squall came on, and we kept
close by the wind until the evening, when we lost
sight of the brig, and at nightfall again bore up on
our course.
</p>

<p>
"I was seized with fever two days after this, but
nothing farther occurred to the polacre worth recording,
until we arrived at Havanna on that day fortnight.
When we anchored, I was still very weak, and unable
to leave my hammock, which, as before mentioned,
was slung in the captain's cabin.  On the day after
we arrived, the slaves were all cleaned and had on
deck, and people set to purify the hold, and get every
thing in order, preparatory to a sale of the poor devils,
which was to take place that afternoon.
</p>

<p>
"I could hear a number of voices wrangling on
deck in Spanish, French, and English; and after a
while the captain came down to the cabin, followed
by several of his customers, whom he had invited to
take refreshments, precisely as a horsedealer treats
<i>his</i> after a good day's sale.  There was a Frenchman,
two or three Spanish planters, and an American
gentleman, in the party.  The first and last, happily for
me, proved to be Mr Duquesné, the master of the
house we are in, and his partner, Mr Hudson, who
good-naturedly enquired of the captain which of his
officers it was who lay sick in the hammock.  He
at once told them what he knew of me; the tale was
romantic enough to engage their curiosity; and Mr
Hudson, with a friendliness that I never can forget,
kindled possibly more warmly in consequence of his
son being of the same profession in the American
navy, asked my leave to have me conveyed on shore
to lodgings.  I thanked him, with tears in my eyes;
and by the time he returned for me at nightfall, I had
contrived to get myself dressed as decently as I
could&mdash;my whole apparel, by the way, consisting of my
trousers and shirt, and a piece of a red silk sash bound
round my waist&mdash;and to crawl on deck to await his
coming.
</p>

<p>
"At length he came alongside, and enquired if I
was ready.  I said I was, and turned to thank the
captain of the polacre; but although he had been on
deck the moment before, he was now nowhere to be
seen.  One of the people said he had gone down to
the cabin, and I accordingly asked him to give my
compliments, and say that I would be happy to thank
him for all his kindness before bidding him good-by;
but the man came to the gangway, and told me that the
companion hatch had been locked from within, and
that he dared not open it.  'Very odd sort of person,'
thought I; but as I had no inducement to press my
attentions upon one who had given me so broad a hint
to be off, I stepped into the boat, in which I
encountered Mr Duquesné himself, who, on perceiving that
I was so much better than he expected, and that there
were no bad symptoms about me, would not hear of
my going to a lodging-house, but insisted on
accommodating me with an apartment in his own.
</p>

<p>
"I was a good deal perplexed when I was presented
to Mrs Hudson and her daughter, and apologized
for my piratical appearance, as I made my obeisance
with my broad-brimmed <i>chapeau de paille</i> in my hand,
and my red silk sash round my waist.  'Why, Mr
De Walden,' said she, with a smile, and a most
engaging motherly kindness, 'I must get my boy
William (the young American officer you saw, sir, at the
monte-table), 'to <i>rig</i> you, as he calls it; for you are
certainly, there is no denying it, rather a suspicious-looking
character at present;' but this was too near the
truth to be comfortable, and I blushed deeply.  'Never
mind, Mr De Walden,' continued she, with the most
delicate feminine perception, seasoned with a spice of
archness, however, 'it was no speech of mine&mdash;it was
Mademoiselle Sophie who has already christened you
the young brigand.'"
</p>

<p>
At this part of De Walden's story I looked up&mdash;"And
pray, <i>who</i> is Mademoiselle Sophie, who is so
ready with her <i>soubriquets</i>?"
</p>

<p>
He reddened like a rose&mdash;"Why, sir,&mdash;<i>that is&mdash;she
is</i> Mr Duquesné's only daughter, sir; you may
have seen her."
</p>

<p>
"I think I have, and I see something else, too,"
said I, significantly.
</p>

<p>
"That same evening," he continued, resuming the
thread of his discourse with great celerity, as if
desirous of getting me away from observing his confusion,
"one of the servants, as we were drinking coffee,
brought me a sealed packet, that, from its weight,
seemed to contain money.  I opened it&mdash;it covered
ten doubloons, with these words written in a bold
hand, 'From an outcast, whose heart, although seared
to the world, is warm towards Henry De Walden.&mdash;From
one who has been liberally rewarded by the
owners of the polacre, and can spare it.'
</p>

<p>
"'Very absurd and romantic,' said I.
</p>

<p>
"'Nothing so absurd in ten doubloons, my good
boy, I calculate,' quoth Mr Hudson, scanning my
outward man scrutinizingly.
</p>

<p>
"'Pray, Mr Duquesné, will you be kind enough
to ask who brought this?'
</p>

<p>
"'The man who brought it was dressed like a
Batabano smuggler, sir,' said the servant at whom his
master had made the enquiry.
</p>

<p>
"'Is he below?'
</p>

<p>
"'No, señor; he said it required no answer, and
did not wait.'
</p>

<p>
"I did not much like receiving this alms at the
hands of my fierce ally; but, under all the
circumstances, I thought it prudent to pocket the affront,
without giving farther offence by endeavouring to
search out a man who evidently had no desire to be
found; and, publish it not, I was deucedly in want of
a new suit of sails, as you may guess, which I had no
means of compassing otherwise, short of borrowing;
from those who had been but too kind to me already.
I never met the man who had befriended me
afterwards, until the night you were wounded, when I
saw him in the custody of the town guard, faint and
bleeding.  I have since been several times to see him,
in prison, but he is more morose and severe even in
his weak state than ever he was at the strongest; and
although he cannot prevent my contributing some
little comforts that his state of body, and the rules
of the prison, permit him to enjoy, still he has never
once thanked me; and from his total disregard of all
that the surgeon enjoins, he seems to have made up
his mind to die.
</p>

<p>
"I have now told you all, sir, and here comes your
riotous friend, Mr Listado, to see you.  I hear his
laugh on the stairs;" and so saying he slid out of
the room.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
</h3>

<h4>
A VISION&mdash;THE DYING BUCANIER.
</h4>

<p>
And a devil of a noise did this said Mr Listado
make.  He rattled up the staircase, from side to side,
like a grape-shot in a carronade; banging against the
heavy balustrades, on one hand, and thundering against
the wall on the other; and speaking and laughing and
shouting to half-a-dozen persons, apparently collected
below in the vestibule.  At length the door was
dashed open, and in swung the gentleman, with his
flaunting gingham coat and potato face.  "Brail, my
darling, how goes it, my little man?  Enough of <i>monte</i> you
have had for a while, I guess.  But, heaven love me,
man, we must have you made fit to receive company;
you are to hold a levee presently, do you know that?
This will never do; the birds of the air might build
in your beard&mdash;ah, I have it;" and he straightway
hied him to the window that overlooked the street,
which he threw open, contriving to perform all his
operations with the greatest possible quantity of noise.
</p>

<p>
"I have it," said he,&mdash;"here is little Pepe Biada's
shaving-shop right over against old Pierre Duquesné's
domicile; there&mdash;next door to Pablo Carnero, the ham
and jerked beef man, so I'll hail Pepe.&mdash;Pepe!" bawled
my troublesome friend,&mdash;"Pepe Biada&mdash;trae su
navaja [bring your razor, you villain] pour shavez un
gentilhomme Engles;" and here he grimaced, and
made believe to soap his chin and shave his beard.
</p>

<p>
My bed had this morning been moved nearer to
the window, for the sake of the fresh air, and I could
see, from where I lay, the little Spanish barber, who
was very deaf, sitting in his little shop.  He kept
turning his ear first one side, and then another, in a
vain attempt to make out what was said, as Listado
shouted to him, straining over the balcony as far as
he could, in his endeavour to make him hear.&mdash;"Navaja
y jamon&mdash;navaja y jamon&mdash;para afeytar&mdash;that is,
pour cortar la barba, that is, cuttibus the beardo of this
young fellow."
</p>

<p>
Here the little withered anatomy of a barber seemed
to comprehend him, and thereupon, with a knowing
look, repeated the telegraphic motions of Monsieur
Listado, rubbing his chin and going through the
motion of shaving.
</p>

<p>
"Si, si," roared Listado, "that is it&mdash;navaja y
jamon"&mdash;literally, a razor and a <i>ham</i>.  Possibly honest
Listado, who, with all his ability, never could compass
Spanish, because, as he said, he had previously learned
French, and thus spoke a hash of both, had mistaken
the Spanish word <i>jamon</i> for <i>xabon</i>, the latter meaning soap.
</p>

<p>
Little Pepe first grinned, and then, as Listado
persisted, he stepped into Carnero's shop, and seizing a
ham, held it up to his face, as if he were rubbing his
chin on it, and then laughed, like to fall down where
he stood.
</p>

<p>
Listado at this flew into a great rage&mdash;"Abortion
chicho, mas monkey que homo, yo te mataras&mdash;vous
sera tué&mdash;si vous twistibus your damned ugly mug at
migo"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Bueno&mdash;bueno," roared el barbero, seeing that
nothing would do but the veritable ham and
razor&mdash;"quedas quieto, yo los traere, Don Lorenzo"&mdash;(Laurence
was Listado's name)&mdash;then aside, "ave Maria,
que diablo quiere este loco, con navaja para cortar
jamon?"  (What the deuce can this madman want
with a razor to cut ham?)
</p>

<p>
But as Listado was a liberal fellow, and well-known
among the brown tradespeople, the little barber was
in my room in a minute, made his solemn bow at the
door, with a large tortoiseshell comb stuck in his grey
pelucca (wig), and his little silver basin and towel
under his arm&mdash;his soap-box and razors in the one hand,
and, lo! a capital New York ham in the other.
</p>

<p>
"Pelukero condeñado&mdash;quevas hacer con este pierna
de puerco?" (You infernal wigmaker, what are you
going to do with that leg of pork?)
</p>

<p>
"What am I going to do with it? did you not tell
me to fetch a ham&mdash;<i>jamon</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Listado, "and there it is in your
soap-box, you bothersome little periwig maker&mdash;there,"
striking the utensil out of his hand up into
the air, and cleverly catching it again, when he seized
the soap-brush and stuck it, lather and all, into Pepe's
open mouth&mdash;"that is better than tooth-powder for
you, Pepe, my darling."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" cried little Pepe, laughing and sputtering&mdash;"I
see&mdash;I see&mdash;tu me has pedido para <i>jamon</i>,
queriendo decir <i>xabon</i>&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"  (You have asked
me for ham when you wanted soap.)
</p>

<p>
He at length set to work, and having shaved and
trimmed me, I had my wound dressed, and Mrs
Gerard acting the part of nurse, having previously
got my clothes on shore, and, with womanly kindness
and care, had them all washed, and nicely repaired, I
had my bed made and sprinkled with Cologne water,
and was soon lying on the top of it, arrayed in one of
Mr Duquesné's splendid flowered nightgowns, with a
silk handkerchief bound round my head, and another
in my hand, moistened with fresh lavender;&mdash;the
windows were then thrown open&mdash;the room thoroughly
ventilated&mdash;the floor sprinkled with the aforesaid most
refreshing distillation&mdash;and there I lay in state, like a
grandee's wife in the straw, wonderfully refreshed, and
quite fit to receive company.
</p>

<p>
At this moment, in slid my worthy
medico&mdash;"Good-morning, sair&mdash;good-morning&mdash;you are make
de killing preparation to massacre all de young lady, I
see.  Ah, Monsieur Listado, your most obsequious&mdash;how
you are, Monsieur Listado?"
</p>

<p>
The latter bowed his acknowledgments, and made
a hop, step, and skip towards the door, knocking
chairs and tables about in his way, at a devil of a
rate&mdash;"Oh dere, he makes de much noise as usual&mdash;Monsieur
Listado, dis is one sheek room&mdash;you hear me?"
</p>

<p>
But the Irishman was by this time out of the room,
hailing those below, with stentorian lungs, from the
uppermost landing-place; the echo of his voice, and
their replies, sounding loud and hollow, as they were
reverberated from side to side of the lofty staircase.
</p>

<p>
"Dicky Phantom, mount and ascend, you small villain."
</p>

<p>
A tiny "Ay, ay, sir," floated up from beneath, and
I heard a gradually increasing tap-tapping on the stair,
as of a cat shod with walnuts, and the sound of
suppressed girlish laughter.  There was then a halt
called, apparently, and I heard the rush of female
footsteps, and the rustling of light dresses, along the
passage, and presently a bustle in the boudoir already
mentioned, as of the placing of music stools.  The
next moment, a harp was struck, and three voices,
two female and one male, accompanied by the instrument,
which was struck skilfully and boldly, pealed
along the lofty rooms in most exquisite concord.
</p>

<p>
"Heyday&mdash;why, Listado, my lad, what is all this?"  But
he remained perdue without, and in came Master
Dicky Phantom, with his little drawn cutlass in his
hand, mounted on the sheep, followed by Serjeant
Quacco, as his squire.
</p>

<p>
The music ceased; Listado again made his appearance,
and I received poor Quacco's congratulations,
and little Dicky's caresses.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, massa," said the little fellow, his phraseology
having improved under Quacco's tuition, "Miss
Hudson make me very happy; I call her mamma&mdash;does
she make you happy too, massa?"
</p>

<p>
"I have not seen her, my boy," said I, with a
funny sort of sensation about my brisket&mdash;how
sentimental! for I rather was prepared to like her
somehow; "but for her kindness to you I am very grateful."
</p>

<p>
Here Listado, who had returned, and seemed to be
clumsily practising a step in the balcony, stumbled,
and fell headlong over a Spanish chair, in an absurd
sprawling fashion, like a large frog.  I started, and he
burst into a loud laugh, while the pet-lamb wheeled
about so suddenly, that little Dicky was thrown with
a bang on the floor, and began to cry, when in rushed
two girls, and Mrs Hudson; followed by De Walden,
Mr Hudson, and old Mr Duquesné himself.
</p>

<p>
"There is a scene in a play for you," said I to
myself, quite bothered and confused, as I wagged my
head at this one, and nodded to another, and salaam'd
with my fins, with all the grace of a wounded turtle,
to a third.
</p>

<p>
"You, Monsieur Listado," chirped Doctor Delaville,
like to die with laughter, for the Patlander had
chosen to keep his position on the floor, with his head
sticking through below the arm of the chair&mdash;"you
make several, many noises sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"Me!" shouted Listado.  "Lord, doctor, I am
noiseless as a cat.  I am velvet, doctor, in all my
ways, walkings, and habitudes&mdash;velvet entirely,
doctor&mdash;and dumb as a humming-bird, as ye all know.
Why, I have been compared to a shred of gossamer
floating on the calm summer air, by Helen Hudson
there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I forgot&mdash;de ladies never will hear nosing
against Monsieur Listado; so my good manner shall
make me agree wid dem, and say what dey say&mdash;dat
is, you are quiet as von hooracan, and more gentle as
de wild beas, bear you call.  Ah, you make no sound
more as de tunder&mdash;Ah ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Now you are in your senses again, mon cher
medico.  Miss Hudson, Mademoiselle Sophie
Duquesné, give me leave to introduce you to&mdash;Master
Brail, pilot of His Britannic Majesty's seventy-four
gun-ship, the Midge&mdash;Benjamin Brail, Miss Hudson,
and Mademoiselle Duquesné&mdash;Speak, Benjie, and let
them know you've a tongue in your head, you spalpeen."
</p>

<p>
I made my acknowledgments to the kind-hearted
people, who, after remaining scarcely long enough for
me to get a look at them individually, withdrew, and
left me alone once more with De Walden.
</p>

<p>
"She is a very pretty girl, that young French lady,
De Walden."
</p>

<p>
The youth had steeled himself by this time I saw,
and was not to be caught again.
</p>

<p>
"Very, sir&mdash;a beautiful figure&mdash;but you seemed to
notice Miss Hudson more particularly, sir."
</p>

<p>
There was a slight smile played for an instant on
the handsome fellow's countenance, and vanished
again, as he resumed his reading.
</p>

<p>
"Hem, ahem&mdash;the breeze is deuced strong," said
I.  "Do me the favour to shut the blind, De
Walden&mdash;beg pardon for all this trouble."
</p>

<p>
He did so, and I gained the advantage I aimed at,
which was, to darken the room so as to render it
impossible for any change in one's beautiful complexion
to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"Why, I scarcely noticed the little lady, do you
know, De Walden?"&mdash;He certainly seemed not to
have known it.&mdash;"She is a nice little person&mdash;rather
too petite, however, for my taste, and not very
sylph-like; a fine skin, certainly, and beautiful hair&mdash;but
then her high nose&mdash;and her eyes are not very good
either&mdash;much too small and light&mdash;besides, she is
shortsighted."
</p>

<p>
De Walden's smile showed he was not, at any rate.
</p>

<p>
"And as for eyebrows, why, the superb arch of
Miss Duquesné's is infinitely finer, and beats them
hollow&mdash;her neck and throat tolerable, certainly; and
the kindliness of her manner!&mdash;why, she comports
herself like a little matron beside a sick-bed; and the
way she handles little Dicky!&mdash;didn't you notice it,
De Walden?  No wonder he called her mamma, poor
little fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever hear her sing, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No, unless it was her voice I heard but just now
in the other room."
</p>

<p>
"You guess rightly.  Miss Duquesné sang the
second to her first.  Two voices never did in this
world blend so sweetly."
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said I, fearing he was again cruising too
near me, "the pipe was good enough&mdash;liquid and
musical-glass like; but Miss Sophie Duquesné's&mdash;<i>that</i>
was a voice indeed&mdash;so deep for a woman, so
clear, so full-bodied."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, sir," said De Walden, archly, "are you
speaking of the qualities of London porter, or
Mademoiselle Duquesné's voice?"
</p>

<p>
I looked at the young midshipman; and, darkened
as the room was, I saw the rogue laughing heartily in
his sleeve.
</p>

<p>
"You seem to have noted a good many of Miss
Hudson's peculiarities, however, my dear sir; considering
you paid so <i>little attention</i> to her, and had so
short a time to take your observation."
</p>

<p>
"I don't know," said I.  "Has she been often in
my room since I was wounded, for I have dreamed of
such a being, I will not deny?"
</p>

<p>
A low "Hush" was here breathed from the
boudoir.  De Walden gave an intelligent nod, and I
became suddenly afflicted with deafness, and overtaken
by a fidgety fit; so I asked him to assist me to change
my position, as it was becoming uneasy, and we both
with one accord hauled our wind on the other tack.
</p>

<p>
"But whose was the male voice that joined so
beautifully in the song?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr Listado's, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Moin&mdash;moy voice&mdash;oh, Lord!"&mdash;said some one
in subdued Tipperary in the next room.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said De Walden, laughing aloud, "no
eavesdropping, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Mr De Walden," said I, "did you perceive
the earthquake early this morning?  How peculiar
the sensation&mdash;how undefinable the mysterious noise
preceding the shock!"
</p>

<p>
"I did, sir.  We have had several slight shocks
lately here, but no one seems to mind them.  I was
afraid it would disturb you, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Why, it did so, certainly; but I soon fell asleep
again."&mdash;A long pause.&mdash;"No appearance of
Gazelle yet, <i>Mister</i> De Walden?" borrowing the stiff
formula of the quarterdeck, to rub out, as it were,
any little familiarity that had passed.
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Surely she might have been round, although I
have no objections to her staying out, until I am up
and about again.  Have you heard any thing more of
Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"I went to the prison to see him last night.
He is looking very ill and pale, poor devil, but does
not complain.  The jailer again told me, that the
moment you were strong enough to make your
deposition before the <i>Juez</i>, he would be discharged."
</p>

<p>
"And the desperado who wounded me?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, he has been better, and worse, several
times, sir.  His uncontrollable temper throws him
back, while the strength of his constitution does
wonders.  He was not expected to live over the second
day, but, to the surprise of the surgeon of the prison,
he rallied astonishingly, and was in fact getting well
until yesterday, when Lennox was taken into his
room to endeavour to identify him, since which he
has been much worse, and the scene must have had a
strong effect on Lennox himself."
</p>

<p>
"As how?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you know, he is an extraordinary creature;
in fact, he is crazy now and then, as he says
himself, and certainly he conducted himself last
evening more like a lunatic than a sane person."
</p>

<p>
The doctor had retired with the ladies, and now
returned for his hat and cane.
</p>

<p>
"My dear doctor, do you think it would do me
any harm to be moved the length of the prison
to-morrow in a litter?  I am very desirous to see the
marine who is confined there for stabbing the bravo
who waylaid me."
</p>

<p>
"I know all about dat, capitain.  To-morrow shall
be too soon, very,&mdash;but next day, may be."
</p>

<p>
I thanked him, and determined to wait patiently
until then.
</p>

<p>
The intervening period was one of great comfort
and happiness to me.  Old Dick had my things
sent ashore, and was most assiduous in his attention,
whenever he could spare time from his repairs
on board.  Over and and over again I blessed
Heaven for its mercy, in throwing me amongst such
kindly people.  Oh, who can appreciate the tenderness
of woman's attentions like the friendless sufferer,
who has languished amongst strangers in a foreign
land on a bed of sickness?
</p>

<p>
Two or three days elapsed, during which I rapidly
got better; so that, on the fourth, I was enabled to
walk, with the support of De Walden's arm, to the
prison, in place of being carried on a litter.
</p>

<p>
When we arrived, we were shown into the room
where Lennox was confined: it was about five in
the afternoon of a very hot, sultry day.  The
marine was sitting in his frock and trowsers, with his
back towards us, looking out through the iron bars
of the unglazed window, that commanded a long
street, and fronted the west.  The creaking of the
rusty lock, and clanking of the chain and bolt that
secured the door of the lofty apartment, did not
disturb him: he merely, as he sat with his legs crossed
on the small wooden chair, with his clasped hands on
his knee, nodded slightly, but without turning his
face, and said&mdash;"Come in."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Lennox," said De Walden, "here is Mr
Brail at last.  You were not beginning to lose heart,
were you?"
</p>

<p>
On this the poor fellow rose and confronted us.
There was a sad change in his appearance since I saw
him: he was pale and wan, with an unusual anxiety
and apparent feverishness about him, and an unsettled
sparkling of his eye, that, from what I previously
had known of his history, but too clearly indicated
that his reason was more unsettled than usual.
</p>

<p>
"I am very grateful for this visit," said he at
length, without directly answering Mr De Walden.
"I am glad to see you so far recovered, sir; but you
look thin and pale yet: this will soon disappear, I
hope&mdash;I trust it will soon disappear."  Here his voice
sank into an unintelligible murmur, and his eye fell,
as if he were repeating the words to himself, without
being conscious of their meaning&mdash;as if he had been
maundering, to use his own phrase.
</p>

<p>
"Well, I have no doubt it will, and I have good
reason to believe that you will be soon quite well
too, Lennox; so get ready.  I presume you know
you are to appear before the <i>Juez</i> this afternoon,
where you will instantly be released, I am told.  Mr
De Walden and I are waiting for you."
</p>

<p>
He said nothing, but stooped down to gather some
clothes that lay on a low pallet in the corner of the
room; which having tied up in a bundle, he lifted
his hat, and stood in the middle of the apartment
ready to go.  His <i>oddness</i>&mdash;it was not sullenness of
manner, I knew&mdash;surprised me a good deal; but I
said nothing, and the jailer now turned to conduct us
into the court, where the judge was waiting to take
my deposition.  We had advanced ten or twelve
paces along the dark stone passage, when Lennox,
who was bringing up the rear, suddenly turned back,
without speaking, and entered his prison-room;
shutting the door very unceremoniously after him, and
thereby depriving us of every particle of light where
we stood.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," said De Walden, "Master Lennox, this
is not over and above civil."
</p>

<p>
"El marinero ese es loco, señor."  (That sailor
is mad, sir), quoth the jailer.
</p>

<p>
"Mad or not, I will see if I cannot make him mend
his manners," said I, as I returned with the young
midshipman, groping for the door.  We found it on
the latch, and pushing it open, saw our <i>amigo</i> coolly
seated in his chair, looking out of the window in
precisely the same attitude as when we first entered.
</p>

<p>
"Now, sir," said I, really angry, "will you favour
me with a reason for this most extraordinary
conduct&mdash;this indecent behaviour to your superior officer,
and I may add to myself, to whom you have professed
yourself beholden?  I am willing to make great
allowances for your <i>infirmity</i>, as you call it; but this
is a little too much on the brogue, my fine fellow."  I
had moved round in front of him by this time.  He
had dropped his eyes on the ground, with his hand
pressed on his forehead; but in an instant he rose
up, endeavouring to hide the tears that were rolling
over his cheeks.
</p>

<p>
"Will you and Mr De Walden listen to me for
five minutes, captain, before we go into court?"
</p>

<p>
"I scarcely am inclined to humour you in your
absurdities, Lennox; but come, if you have any
thing to say, out with it at once&mdash;make haste, my
man."  Seeing he hesitated, and looked earnestly at
the jailer&mdash;"Oh, I perceive&mdash;will you have the
kindness to leave us alone with the prisoner for five
minutes?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said the man&mdash;"I shall remain outside."
</p>

<p>
The moment he disappeared, Lennox dropped on
his knees, and seemed to be engaged in prayer for
some moments: he then suddenly rose, and retired a
few paces from us.  "Gentlemen, what I am going to
tell you I have seen, you will very possibly ascribe to
the effects of a heated imagination; nevertheless, I
will speak the truth.  The man who wounded you,
Mr Brail, and now lies in the last extremity in the
next room"&mdash;here he seemed to be suffocating for
want of breath&mdash;"is no other than Mr Adderfang,
the villain who through life has been my evil genius.
Ay, you may smile incredulously; I expected nothing
else; but it is nevertheless true, and even he shall, if he
can speak when you see him, confirm what I have told
you.  Do you not see the palpable intervention of an
overruling Providence in this, gentlemen?  <i>Here</i> I
encounter, against all human probability, in a strange
country, with the very fiend who drove me forth,
broken-hearted and deranged in mind, from my own!  It
is not chance, gentlemen&mdash;you will blaspheme,"
continued he impetuously, "if you call it chance&mdash;one from
the dead has visited me, and told me it was not chance."  His
eye flashed fire as he proceeded with great animation
and fluency&mdash;"Mr Brail, do not smile&mdash;do not smile.
Believe me that I speak the words of truth and soberness,
when I tell you that <i>she</i> was <i>here</i> last night;
ay, as certainly as there is a God in heaven to
reward the righteous and punish iniquity."
</p>

<p>
I let him go on.
</p>

<p>
"I was sitting, as you saw me, in that chair, sir,
looking forth on the setting moon, as it hung above
the misty hill-top, and was watching its lower limb
as it seemed to flatten and lose its roundness against
the outline of the land, and noticing the increasing
size of the pale globe as the mist of morning rose
up and floated around it,&mdash;when I heard a deep sigh
close behind me.  I listened, and could distinguish
low moaning sobs, but I had no power to turn round
to look what it was.  Suddenly the window before
me became gradually obscured, the dark walls thinned
and grew transparent, the houses and town disappeared,
and I was conscious, ay, as sensible as I am
that I speak to you now, Mr Brail, that I saw before
me my own mountain lake, on the moonlight bank
of which I last parted from Jessy Miller before she fell.
</p>

<p>
"The waning planet seemed to linger on the hill,
and shed a long sickly wake on the midnight tarn,
that sleeped in the hollow of the mountain, bright
and smooth as if the brown moss had been inlaid with
polished steel, except where a wild-duck glided over
the shining surface, or the wing of the slow-sailing
owl flitted winnowingly across, dimming it for a
moment, like a mirror breathed upon.  I was sitting on
the small moss-grown cairn, at the eastern end; the
shadow of the black hills was cast so clearly in the
water, that you could not trace the shore of the
small lake, nor define the water-line beneath the
hazel bushes; and the stars were reflected in another
heaven scarcely less pure than their own.  I heard
the rushing of the burn over its rugged channel, as it
blended with the loch, and the melancholy bleating
of the sheep on the hill-side, and the low bark of the
colleys, and the distant shout of the herds watching
the circular folds, high up on the moor,&mdash;when I felt
a touch on my shoulder, and, glancing down, I saw a
long, pale female hand resting on it, as of a person,
who was standing behind me: it was thin and wasted,
and semi-transparent as alabaster, or a white cornelian
stone, with the blue veins twining amongst the
prominent sinews, and on the marriage-finger there was
a broken ring&mdash;I saw it as clearly as I see my own
hand now, for the ends of the small gold wire of
which it was composed stood up and out from the
fleshless finger.  I kenned weel who was there, but I
had no power to speak.  The sigh was repeated, and
then I heard a low still voice, inarticulate and scarcely
audible at first, like a distant echo from the hill-side,
although I had a fearful conviction that it was uttered
close behind me;&mdash;presently it assumed a composed
but most melancholy tone&mdash;yes, Mr Brail, so sure as
there is a God above us, Jessy Miller&mdash;yea, the dead
spoke in that awful moment to the living."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nonsense, man!" I said; "really you are
getting mad in earnest now, Lennox; this will never do."
</p>

<p>
He paid no attention to me, but went on&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"'Saunders,' it said, 'I have come to tell you that
him ye ken o'&mdash;he wha crushed my heart until it
split in twain&mdash;he wha heaped the mools on my
head, and over the child I bare him&mdash;will also help
you to an early grave.'  The hand on my shoulder
grew heavy as lead.  'He has meikle to answer for
to you, Saunders, and I have mair; and to me he
has&mdash;&mdash;but <i>I</i> maun dree my weird.'  Here the voice
was choked in small inaudible sobs, blending with
which I thought I heard the puling as of a new-born
baby, when a gradually swelling sough came down the
hill-side, like the rushing of the blast through the
glen, and the water in the placid loch trembled in
the waning moonbeams like that in a moss-hag[<a id="chap02fn1text"></a><a href="#chap02fn1">1</a>] when
a waggon rolls past, and the hitherto steady reflection
of the stars in it twinkled and multiplied as if each
spark of living fire had become two; and although
there was not a breath out of heaven, small ripples
lap-lapped on the pebbly shore, and a heavy shower of
dew was shaken from the leaves of the solitary auld
saugh that overhung the northern bank of the wee
loch, sparkling in the moonlight like diamonds; and
the scathed and twisted oak stump on the opposite
hill that bisected the half-vanished disk of the sinking
moon, as she lingered like a dying friend looking his
last at us, shook palpably to and fro, and a rotten
limb of it fell;&mdash;ay, the solid earth of the cold hill-side
itself trembled and heaved, as if they who slept in the
grey cairn beneath had at that moment heard the
summons of the Archangel;&mdash;when, lo! the dead hand was
withdrawn with a faint shriek, like the distant cry of
the water-hen, and I turned in desperation to see&mdash;what? a
thin wreath of white mist float up the hill-side,
and gradually melt into the surrounding darkness.  And
once more I was seated where you now see me, with
that rusty stanchel clearly defined against the small
segment of the moon, that still lingered above the
horizon.  The next moment it was gone, and I was
left in darkness."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"All a dream, Lennox; all a phantasy of your
heated imagination.  There was a slight shock of an
earthquake last night at the time you mention, just
at the going down of the moon, and that was the
noise you heard and the tremor you perceived, so
rouse yourself, man.  Adderfang, if it really be him,
from all accounts, is dying, and you will soon be safe
from <i>his</i> machinations, at all events."
</p>

<p>
He shook his head mournfully, but said nothing
more&mdash;whether my arguments had convinced him or
no, was another thing&mdash;but we all proceeded to the
room where the judge was waiting for us, and my
declaration immediately freed poor Lennox; after
which we were requested to accompany the officers of
the court, who, along with their interpreter, were
proceeding to the wounded man's room, to take his
dying declaration.
</p>

<p>
The daylight had entirely failed by the time we
reached the cell where Adderfang lay.  We were
met at the door by a Carmelite priest, who appeared
in great wrath, and muttered something about a
"Heretico condeñado."  We entered.  It was an
apartment of the same kind as the one in which
Lennox had been confined, and had a low pallet on
one side, fronting the high iron-barred window.  From
the darkness I could merely make out that some
person lay on the bed, writhing about, apparently in
great pain.  A candle was brought, and we could see
about us.  It shone brightly on the person of a tall
bushy-whiskered desperado, who lay on the bed,
covered by a sheet, groaning and breathing very
heavily.  I approached; his features were very sharp
and pale, his lips black, and his beard unshaven; his
eyes were shut, and his long hair spread all over the
pillow.
</p>

<p>
He appeared to be attended by a slight, most beautiful
Spanish girl; apparently a fair mulatto, who was
sitting at the head of the bed, brushing away the
musquittoes, and other night flies, with a small bunch
of peacock's feathers; while the hot tears trickled
down her cheeks, and over her quivering lips, until
they fell on her distracted and heaving bosom.  But
she was silent; her sobs were even inaudible; her
grief was either too deep for utterance, or the fear of
disturbing the dying moments of her lover made her dumb.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "O, Woman! in our hours of ease,<br />
  Uncertain, coy, and hard to please,<br />
  And variable as the shade<br />
  By the light quivering aspen made;<br />
  When pain and anguish wring the brow,<br />
  A ministering angel thou!"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Hearing a bustle in the room, Adderfang now spoke,
in a low and interrupted voice&mdash;it was in Spanish.
</p>

<p>
"Padre, do not persist&mdash;I do not want your
services&mdash;you cannot smooth my pillow&mdash;do not
therefore try to strew more thorns there&mdash;Heaven knows
they are numerous enough, and sharp enough already."
</p>

<p>
"Can this be the villain who stabbed me?" said I,
somewhat moved.
</p>

<p>
The poor girl at this stooped down, and whispered
something into his ear.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said he, "I had forgot&mdash;I had forgot; but
your tears scald me, Antonia&mdash;hot&mdash;hot;" and with
a sudden effort, as if ashamed to evince how much he
was suffering, and a fierce energy, he controlled the
twitching of his feverish limbs, clasped his hands on
his bosom, and opening his blood-shot eyes for the
first time, took a steady survey of us.  He then
glanced to the jailer.
</p>

<p>
"This is the gentleman who was stabbed by you,"
said the Spaniard.  He nodded.  "This is the English
marine, Lennox, who came up with the guard and
took you prisoner."
</p>

<p>
I could not help remarking, when Lennox was
introduced to him, that the wounded man smiled
bitterly, as much as to say&mdash;"I know <i>him</i> but too well,
and he has fearful cause to know <i>me</i>."  "Mr Brail,"
said he (I had to stoop to catch his words, he spoke
in so low a tone), "I am aware of the object of this
visit&mdash;it is all proper.  Let the escribano there get
his paper ready; I shall make short work of the
confessional."
</p>

<p>
The man sat down.  Adderfang again shut his eyes,
and seemed for a few moments to be gathering his
thoughts about him; at length&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I acknowledge that I stabbed the Englishman, Mr
Brail, and robbed him afterwards; and that the
English marine, Lennox, acted nobly and honourably in
coming to the assistance of his countryman.  He was
the man who wounded me.  There you have it all;
engross it, and I will sign it."
</p>

<p>
As if desirous of being heard distinctly, he had, as
he pronounced these words with difficulty, in detached
sentences, raised himself on his left arm, and now, as
if exhausted, he fell back with his head on poor
Antonia's lap.
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The tackle of <i>his</i> heart was cracked and burned,<br />
  And all the shrouds wherewith <i>his</i> life should sail,<br />
  Are turned to one poor thread, one little hair."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
There was a long pause.
</p>

<p>
"But why," said the Juez at length&mdash;"why did
you waylay Mr Brail?"
</p>

<p>
"For two reasons," replied the dying bravo; "first,
because I harboured revenge for the destruction of
my vessel by the Midge, <i>steered by him</i>, as that young
gentleman afterwards told me" (here De Walden and
I exchanged looks), "on the bar of the African river;
secondly, because he took my last stiver from me at
the gaming-table."
</p>

<p>
"Evil motives both, my son, to be entertained by
any, but especially by one standing on the threshold
of eternity.  Let me recall the priest, that he may
shrive you, and probably, with God's blessing, induce
you to repent before you go hence."
</p>

<p>
I turned to look at the person who spoke.  He was
a tall and very dark Spaniard, his age might have been
sixty, and his short and scanty hair was of a silver grey.
He was plainly dressed in black, and sat at a small
table, and opposite to him the escribano, or notary, with
his paper before him, and pen held up between him.
and the candle, and ready wet with ink.
</p>

<p>
"It is of no use, <i>and I will not</i>," said Adderfang;
"besides, if I am any thing at all, I am a Protestant&mdash;and
as the tree falls, so must it lie&mdash;it is a part of
my creed.&mdash;<i>Creed</i>!" he here interjected to himself
with great bitterness&mdash;"<i>my creed!</i> whatever it may
be of yours, and I feel that all the roots that knit me
to the earth have already parted, save one; therefore,
let me die, if not in peace, at least in quietness."
</p>

<p>
He stopped to take breath, and when he proceeded,
it was in a voice even more weak and trembling
than before.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Heaven knows, villain as I have been, that
they have all snapped <i>but one</i>"&mdash;and he caught the
hand of the poor girl, and tried to place it on his
heart, but his strength failed him.  She wept aloud at
this unexpected burst of feeling, and the contagion of
her tears extended even to the stony heart of the
wounded man himself.  The iron had at length
entered into his soul, and what the retrospect of his own
ill-spent life&mdash;what the intensity of his present agony,
and the fearful prospect before him through eternity,
could not wring from him&mdash;now flowed at the sight
of the poor girl's misery, as if his bosom had been a
tender woman's.  He wept aloud.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;my evil courses have but too justly estranged
all my kindred from me; one friend has dropped off
after another, until, in the prime of life, after having
squandered a handsome patrimony, and having been
educated as a gentleman, with every thing around me
that ought to have made me happy, to this have I
come at last!"  He groaned heavily.  "You see
before you, Mr Brail, not a <i>fiend, but an everyday
villain</i>&mdash;a man not naturally wicked&mdash;one who did
not love evil for evil's sake, but who became the
willing slave of his passions, and held no law, human or
divine, in reverence, when they were to be gratified.
Ay, William Adderfang, here you lie on a death-bed
from violence&mdash;from a wound sustained in the act of
stabbing and robbing another, to gratify revenge, and
the paltry desire of repossessing money squandered at
the gaming-table, and with the certainty that, if a
miracle interposed, and you recovered, your life would
still be taken on the scaffold.  Ay, here you lie,"
continued he with increasing energy, "without one
soul in the wide world to say God bless you, or to
close your eyes when you are gone, but my poor
Antonia here."
</p>

<p>
Here the unhappy girl's anguish became uncontrollable,
although she could not have understood what
he said, and she threw herself on the bed in such a
position as to give her paramour great pain; a
shudder passed over his face, and he endeavoured to turn
himself round, so as to gain an easier position.  In
the action the wound in his side burst out afresh, and
presently a dark puddle coagulated on the sheet at his
right side.  The doctor of the prison was in immediate
attendance, and applied styptics to stanch the
bleeding; all the time he seemed in a dead faint&mdash;he
made no movement, and when the wound was dressed,
and he was replaced on his bed, I did not know, as I
bent over him, whether the spirit had fled or not.
</p>

<p>
Lennox, with the judge's permission, now took one
of the candles from the table, and held it to his
face&mdash;he still breathed.  But in the silence within the
room, I perceived that the weather without began to
grow gusty and boisterous; I could hear the rain
lashing against the wall of the prison, and the blast
howled round the roof, and threatened to extinguish
the candle.  The freshness of the night wind,
however, reanimated the sufferer in a wonderful degree;
and when I rose, with an intention of closing the
shutters, to prevent the rain beating through on his face,
as he lay propped up on the poor girl's bosom,
fronting the narrow aperture, he had strength enough to
ask me, in a low husky voice, "to leave it open, the
coolness and moisture revived him."
</p>

<p>
Lennox now spoke&mdash;"Mr Adderfang, I have come
on purpose to say that I"&mdash;his voice faltered, and he
leant against the wall for a brief space&mdash;"to say that
<i>I forgive you</i>&mdash;ay, as freely as I hope God will
forgive me at the last day.  Give me your hand, Mr
Adderfang, and say you forgive me also for having
wounded you."
</p>

<p>
The dying man shrunk from him, and drew his hand
back&mdash;"No, no, Saunders, you cannot be sincere, you
cannot be sincere; you cannot have forgotten <i>her</i>
injuries, you cannot have forgiven your own."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the poor fellow solemnly, "I have
prayed for many a long year that I might be able to
forgive you&mdash;even <i>you</i>; and my prayer has been
heard at last.  Oh, if you would even at the ninth
hour appeal to the same merciful Being, might he
not show his mercy to your dying soul?"
</p>

<p>
"I cannot&mdash;I cannot pray," said Adderfang, as
impetuously as his weakness would let him&mdash;"I cannot
pray&mdash;I have never prayed, Saunders&mdash;oh, would to
God I had! would that I could redeem but one short
week!  But it would be of no avail," groaned he, in
a low altered tone&mdash;"all has been foreordained&mdash;I
have been the slave of an irrevocable destiny&mdash;I could
have acted no otherwise than I have done; and if
there be a hereafter and a God"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"If there be!" said I, "Heaven have mercy on
you, Mr Adderfang, and turn your heart even now in
your extremity."
</p>

<p>
"Oh!  Mr Brail, I know myself&mdash;I am quite
conscious of my inherent wickedness&mdash;the damning
conviction is burned in on my heart, that even if I were
to recover, I should again fall into the same courses&mdash;I
am quite certain of it; so why appeal to the
Invisible"&mdash;he paused and gasped for breath&mdash;"why
insult Heaven with vain promises of amendment, which
I could not and would not keep were I to survive? why
play the hypocrite now? why lie to God, when"&mdash;here
he put his hand to his side, as if in great
suffering&mdash;"when, if there be such a Being, I must, in
all human probability, appear before him in half an
hour, when no lie will serve me?&mdash;But let me do an
act of justice&mdash;yes, call the priest"&mdash;he now spoke in
Spanish&mdash;"call the priest.  Rise, Antonia, and kiss
me; you are another victim"&mdash;he groaned again&mdash;"I
promised you marriage before I wove my web of
deceit round your innocent heart; you have often
prayed me to remember that solemn promise, since
you were ensnared, and I have as often laughed you
to scorn, or answered you with a brutal jest; I will
accede to your request now; call the priest, let him be
quick, or death will prevent"&mdash;He swooned again.
</p>

<p>
Presently the venerable friar, without any trace of
anger at the previous rejection of his services, was
at the bedside.  I never shall forget the scene.  It
was now quite dark, and the two large brown wax
tapers were flickering in the current of air that came
strong through the window, and stirred the few hairs
of the venerable Juez, who sat at the table.  The
lights cast a changeful glare on his face, and on that
of the old priest, who was standing beside the pillow
of the dying man, dressed in his long dark robe, with
a cord round his waist, supporting a silver crucifix
that glanced in the light; and on the tall form of the
beautiful Spanish girl, that lay across the bed, her
naked feet covered by neat grass slippers, and on her
pale olive complexion, and fine features, and her hair
plaited in three distinct braids, that hung down her
back, intertwined with black ribbon; and sparkled in
her large black swimming eye, and on the diamond-like
tears that chased each other over her beautiful
features and swelling and more than half-naked bosom.
Lennox and myself were all this time standing at the
foot of the bed; De Walden was leaning on the back
of the escribano's chair, with his face so turned as to
see that of the wounded man, who lay still as death,
the yellow light shining by fits full on his sunburnt
complexion, and unshaven chin (the flickering
shadows making his features appear as if convulsed, if
they really were not so), and strong muscular neck,
and glancing on the auburn curls, clotted with the
cold perspiration wrung from his forehead by intense
suffering.
</p>

<p>
He gradually recovered.  The priest signed to
Antonia to rise, and I took her place on the bed; he
placed her hand in that of Adderfang, who looked
steadily and consciously at him, but he could not
speak.  The service proceeded, the gusts without
increasing, and the rain lashing to a degree that
almost drowned the old man's voice.  Adderfang
being unable to repeat the responses, merely acknowledged
them by an inclination of his head, and a silent
movement of his lips; at length, when it was asked
of him, "Do you take this woman to be your wife?"
he made an effort, and replied distinctly, "Yes."
</p>

<p>
Ha! what is that?  A flash of lightning&mdash;a piercing
shriek echoed through the room, loud above the
rolling thunder&mdash;and then a convulsive giggle&mdash;something
fell heavily on the floor&mdash;the wind howled, the
lights were blown out&mdash;"Ave Maria purissima&mdash;sancta
madre&mdash;soy ciega&mdash;soy ciega!" (Holy Mother
of God, I am struck blind&mdash;I am struck blind!)  The
unfortunate girl had, indeed, been struck by the
electric fluid, and was now writhing sightless on the
floor: we endeavoured to remove her, but she had
got her arms twined round the foot of the bed, and
resisted all our efforts.  "Dexa me morir cerca mi
querido&mdash;ah Dios! dexa me morir aqui."  Lights
were immediately procured, and the shutters closed;
and there lay Adderfang, apparently quite sensible,
but now glaring round him, like a dying tiger.  I
never can forget the bitter smile that played on his
haggard features, like the lurid glare of a stormy
sunset.  I turned away and shuddered, but curiosity
compelled me to look at him again.  He shook his head,
as his eye caught mine, and pointed upward, as if he
had said, "You see the very heavens league against
me."  He then signed for some cordial that stood on
the table: having drank it, it revived him for a
minute almost miraculously.  He again shed a flood of
tears, and, sobbing audibly, clasped his hands on his
bosom and prayed aloud.  Yes, the assassin, the
libertine, the selfish, cold-hearted seducer, for a short
minute bent meekly as a child before the storm of
his sufferings!
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Almighty God, whose laws I have so fearfully
contemned, hear my prayers for her&mdash;hear the
prayers of one <i>who dare not pray for himself</i>!"
</p>

<p>
A low, growling thunderclap had gradually rolled
on from a distance as he proceeded; but when he got
this length, it roared overhead in a series of loud
reports, as if a seventy-four had fired her broadside
close to us, shaking the dust from the roof and walls
of the room, and making the whole prison tremble,
as at the upheaving of an earthquake.  He ceased&mdash;when
the noise gradually grumbled itself to rest in the
distance, and again nothing but the howling of the
tempest without was heard.
</p>

<p>
"The voice of the Almighty," at length he said,
speaking in short sentences with great difficulty, and
in a low, sigh-like voice,&mdash;"yea, the sound of my
condemnation.  Heaven will not hear my prayers,
but with its thunders drowns the voice of my
supplication&mdash;rejecting my polluted sacrifice, like that of
Cain.  I am ruined and condemned here and
hereafter&mdash;palpably condemned by the Eternal, even while
yet on earth, body and soul&mdash;body and soul&mdash;condem"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
He ceased&mdash;a strong shiver passed over his face&mdash;his
jaw fell; and Lennox, stepping up to him, closed
his eyes&mdash;stooped his cheek towards his mouth to
perceive if he still breathed&mdash;then holding up his
hand, solemnly said, "<i>He hath departed!</i>"

CHAPTER III.
</h3>

<h4>
SCENES IN HAVANNA.
</h4>

<p class="poem">
  "Had you ever the luck to see Donnybrook Fair?<br />
  An Irishman all in his glory is there.<br />
  With his sprig of shillelah and shamrock so green."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Now, do make less noise there, my dear Listado&mdash;you
will waken the whole house with your uproarious singing."
</p>

<p>
"Waken the whole house!&mdash;that's a mighty good
one, friend Benjamin&mdash;why, the whole house <i>is</i>
awake&mdash;broad awake as a cat to steal cream, or the devil in
a gale of wind&mdash;Awake! men, women, and children,
black, brown, and white, dogs, cats, pigs, and kittens,
turkeys, peafowls, and the clucking hen, have been
up and astir three hours ago.  Dicky Phantom is
now crying for his dinner&mdash;so, blood and oons, man,
gather your small legs and arms about ye, and get up
and open the door&mdash;it is past twelve, man, and Mother
Gerard thinks you have gone for a six months' snooze,
like a bat in winter; if you don't let me in, I shall
swear you are hanging from the roof by the claws."
</p>

<p>
"I can't help it, man&mdash;I am unable to get up and
dress without assistance; so, like a dear boy, call up
old Nariz de Niéve,[<a id="chap03fn1text"></a><a href="#chap03fn1">1</a>] the black valet, and ask the
favour of his stepping in to help me."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
<a id="chap03fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap03fn1text">1</a>] Literally, <i>Nose of Snow</i>.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Stepping in!&mdash;why, Benjie Brail, your seven
senses are gone a-wool-gathering, like Father
Rogerson's magpie&mdash;how the blazes can Nariz de Niéve, or
any one else, get to you, through a two-inch door,
locked on the inside?&mdash;you must get up and undo it,
or you will die of starvation, for no blacksmith in
Havanna could force such a complication of hardwood
planks and brass knobs."
</p>

<p>
Rather than be bothered in this way, up I got,
with no little difficulty, to say nothing of the pain from
my undressed wound, and crawled towards the door.
But Listado had not patience to wait on my snail's
pace, so, setting his back to it, he gave a thundering
push, sufficient to have forced the gates of Gaza from
their hinges, and banged the door wide open.  It had
only caught on the latch, not having been fastened,
after all; but he had overcome the <i>vis inertiæ</i> rather
too fiercely, for in spun our gingham-coated friend,
with the flight of a Congreve rocket, sliding across
the tiled floor on his breast a couple of fathoms, like a
log squirred along ice.  At length he lost <i>his way</i>, and
found his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"By the piper, but I'll pay you off for this trick,
Master Brail, some fine morning, take Don Lorenzo's
word for it.  Why the devil did you open the door so
suddenly, without telling me?&mdash;see, if these cursed
tiles have not ground off every button on my waistcoat,
or any where else.  I must go into old Pierre
Duquesné's garden, and borrow some fig leaves, as I
am a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
I could scarcely speak for laughing.  "The door was
on the latch, as you see&mdash;it was not fastened, man, at
all&mdash;but you are so impetuous"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Himpetuous!&mdash;why, only look at the knees of
my breeches&mdash;there's himpetuosity for you!&mdash;a full
quarter of a yard of good duck spoiled, not to name
the shreds of skin torn from my knee-pans, big enough,
were they dried into parchment, to hold ten credos,
and&mdash;but that will grow again, so never mind."  Here he
gathered himself up, and, tying a red silk handkerchief
round one knee, a white one round the other, and my
black cravat, which he unceremoniously picked off the
back of a chair, round his waist, like a bishop's apron;
he rose, laughing all the while, and turned right round
on me&mdash;"There, I am all right now&mdash;but I have come
to tell you of a miracle, never surpassed since Father
O'Shauchnessy cured aunt Katey's old pig of the
hystericals&mdash;stop!  I must tell you about that game&mdash;She
was, as you see, an ould maid, and after the last
twelve farrow, she applied to"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I laughed&mdash;"Which was the old maid? the pig, or"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hold your tongue, and give your potato-trap a
holiday.&mdash;Didn't I tell you it was my maiden aunt
Katey, that brought the litter of pigs to Father
O'Shauchnessy?"
</p>

<p>
"The devil she did," quoth I.
</p>

<p>
"To be sure she did," quoth he.&mdash;"So said she to
him, 'Father,' says she&mdash;'Daughter,' says he; and
then before she could get in another word&mdash;'Whose
are them pigs?' says he.&mdash;'Moin, moy pigs,' quoth my
aunt Katey.&mdash;'Your pigs!&mdash;all of them?' says
Father O'Shauchnessy,&mdash;'Every mother's son of them,'
says my aunt Katey&mdash;-'and that is my errand, indeed,
Father O'Shauchnessy, for the poor mother of these
beautiful little creatures is bewitched entirely.'"
</p>

<p>
"Now, Listado, have done, and be quiet, and tell
me your errand," said I, losing patience.
</p>

<p>
"My errand&mdash;<i>my</i> errand, did you say, Benjie
Brail?&mdash;by the powers, and I had all but forgotten
my errand&mdash;but let me take a look at you&mdash;why,
what a funny little fellow you are in your linen
garment, Benjie&mdash;laconic&mdash;short, but expressive"&mdash;and
he turned me round in so rough a way, that he really
hurt me considerably.  Seeing this, and that I had to
sit down on the side of the bed for support, the
worthy fellow changed his tone&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Bless me, Brail, I shall really be very sorry if I
have hurt you, so I will help you to dress&mdash;but you
certainly do cut a comical figure in dishabille&mdash;however,
you have not heard the other miracle I came to
tell you about, man&mdash;why, Adderfang, that you saw
die last night, and be d&mdash;d to him&mdash;I cannot say much
for his ending, by the way, if all be true that I have
heard&mdash;is not dead at all."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, but it is true&mdash;he was only kilt by his own
bad conscience, the big villain, and your fantastical
<i>flower</i> of sulphur&mdash;your Scotch ally, Lennox, is
below, ready to vouch for it.  If the rascal does
recover, what a beautiful subject for the garrote he will
make.&mdash;What an expressive language this Spanish is,
now&mdash;garrote&mdash;gar-rote&mdash;you don't require to look
your dictionary for the meaning of such a word, the
very sound translates itself to any man's comprehension&mdash;when
you say a fellow is <i>garroteado</i>, don't you
hear the poor devil actually <i>throttling</i>?&mdash;Oh! it's a
beautiful word."
</p>

<p>
Here Manuel, the black butler, entered, to assist in
rigging me, as Nariz de Niéve was occupied
otherwise; and time it was he did so, for Listado was,
without exception, the worst and roughest groom of
the bedchamber that ever I had the misfortune to
cope withal; but the plaguey Irishman must still put
in his oar.
</p>

<p>
"Manuel, my worthy," said he, after the negro
was done with me, "do me the favour, para tomar
un asiento&mdash;take a seat&mdash;chaizez votre posterioribus,
si vous plait, old Snow Ball."
</p>

<p>
By this time, he had shoved Massa Manuel into an
arm-chair, whether he would or no, close to one of
the wooden pillars of the balcony, and, getting behind
him, he, with one hand, threw a towel over his face;
then twisted a handkerchief round his neck, and the
pillar also, with the other, until he had nearly
strangled the poor creature; holding forth all the while,
"There is the real garrote for you&mdash;a thousand times
more genteel than hanging.&mdash;See, Brail, you sit down
on your chair thus, quite comfortable&mdash;and the
Spanish Jack Ketch, after covering your face with the
graceful drapery of a shawl&mdash;you may even choose
your pattern, they tell me, instead of dragging a tight
nightcap over your beautiful snout, through which
every wry mouth you make is seen&mdash;with one turn of
his arm, so!"&mdash;Here, as he suited the action to the
word, the half-choked Manuel spurred with all his
might with his feet, and struggled with his hands, as
if he had really been in the agonies of death, and I
am not sure that he was far from them.  At length he
made a bolt from the chair, cast off the handkerchief
that had been wrung round his neck, and rushed out
of the room, never once looking behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Now, there! did you ever see such an uncivil
ould savage, to stop me just in the middle of my
elegant illustration.  However, we shall both go and see
this arch scoundrel, Adderfang, <i>garroteadoed</i> yet&mdash;and
there I have rigged you now complete&mdash;not a bad
looking little fellow, I declare, after your togs are
fittingly donned.&mdash;So, good by, Brail, I will go home
and see about breakfast"&mdash;and away he tumbled with
his usual reckless shamble.
</p>

<p>
He had left the room, and was drawing the door to
after him, when in came honest Dick Lanyard&mdash;"Ah,
Don Ricardo," shouted the Irishman&mdash;"glad to
see you&mdash;now I can leave our friend with a safe
conscience; but he is not quite the thing yet here"&mdash;and
the villain pointed to his forehead.  He vanished,
but again returned suddenly, as if he had forgotten
something, and banging the door open with greater
noise than ever, re-entered, with all the <i>sang froid</i>
imaginable, dragging at a large parcel that was stuffed
into his coat pocket, which he had considerable
difficulty in extricating, apparently.  At last, tearing it
away, lining and all, he presented it to me, still sticking
in the disruptured pouch.
</p>

<p>
"Now, there, if I have not torn out the very
entrails of my coat skirt with your cursed parcel&mdash;but
beg pardon, Benjie, really I had forgotten it;
although, if the truth must be told, it was the main
object of my coming here.  Ah so&mdash;and here is
another packet for you too, Don Ricardo"&mdash;chucking a
large letter on service to the lieutenant, who eagerly
opened it.  It contained, amongst others, the
following from the commodore:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>H.M.S Gazelle, Port-Royal, Jamaica.</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "<i>Such a date.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
"Sir&mdash;We arrived here, all well, on such a day&mdash;but,
to suit the convenience of the merchants whose
vessels I am to convoy to Havanna, and of those
who are shipping specie to England, the admiral has
detained me for six weeks, so that I shall not be in
Havanna, in all likelihood, before such a period.
You will therefore remain there, taking all necessary
precautions to ensure the health of the men, and you
can use your discretion in making short cruises to
exercise them, and to promote the same; but in no
case are you to be longer than three days without
communicating with the port.
</p>

<p>
"The enclosure is addressed to Corporal Lennox&mdash;it
was forwarded here in the admiral's bag by last
packet from England, superscribed, to be returned to
his office at Portsmouth, in case we had sailed.  It
seems his friends, having ascertained that he was on
board Gazelle, have made interest for his discharge,
which is herewith enclosed.&mdash;I remain, sir, your
obedient servant,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"OLIVER OAKPLANK, K.C.B.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "Commodore.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"To Lieutenant Lanyard, commanding the Midge,<br />
tender to H.M.S. Gazelle," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On receiving this the lieutenant sent for Lennox,
and communicated the intelligence contained in the
commodore's letter.  I could not tell from the
expression of his countenance whether he was glad or
sorry.
</p>

<p>
The parcel contained letters from his father, the
old clergyman of the parish, Mr Bland, and several of
the poor fellow's own friends, detailing how they had
traced him, and requesting, in the belief that the
letters would reach him in Jamaica, that he would find
out a kinsman of his own, a small coffee planter there,
who would be ready to assist him; and, in the mean
time, for immediate expenses, the minister's letter
covered a ten-pound bank of England note, with
which he had been furnished by old Skelp, who,
curiously enough, would not trust it in his own, as it
the clergyman's envelope carried a sort of sanctity
with it.
</p>

<p>
The marine consulted me as to what he ought to
do; I recommended him to proceed to Jamaica immediately
by way of Batabano, and to visit the relation,
who had been written to, as he might be of service to
him, and accordingly he made his little preparations
for departure.
</p>

<p>
My packet contained long letters from my Liverpool
friends, that had been forwarded to the care of
our Kingston correspondent; but, to my surprise,
none from my uncle, Mr Frenche, mentioned at the
outset as being settled in Jamaica.
</p>

<p>
In the mean time, I continued rapidly to improve,
and three days after this I found myself well enough
to go on board the Midge, and visit my friends there.
It was the day on which Lennox was to leave her;
and as the men's dinner-time approached, I saw one of
the boat sails rigged as an awning forward, and
certain demonstrations making, and a degree of bustle in
the galley that <i>prog</i>nosticated, as Listado would have
said, a treat to his messmates.  However, Lanyard and
I returned on shore, after the former had given
Drainings, the cook, and old Dogvane the quartermaster,
leave for that afternoon to go on shore with the
marine.
</p>

<p>
About sunset the same evening, as I was returning
from an airing into the country in Mr Duquesné's
volante, who should I overtake but the trio above
alluded to, two of them in a very comfortable
situation as it appeared.  First came Dogvane and
Lennox, with little Pablo Carnero, the Spanish ham
merchant and pig butcher before mentioned, who was a
crony of the marine, between them, all very respectably
drunk, and old Drainings bringing up the rear, not
many degrees better.
</p>

<p>
The quartermaster was in his usual dress, but the
little Spanish dealer in pork hams was figged out in
nankeen tights, and a flowing bright-coloured
gingham coat, that fluttered in the wind behind him, and
around him, as if it would have borne up his tiny
corpus into the air, like a bat or a Brobdingnag
butterfly; or possibly a flying-squirrel would be the better
simile, as he reeled to and fro under the tyranny of
the rosy god, making drunken rushes from Lennox to
Dogvane, and back again; tackling to them alternately,
like the nondescript spoken of in his leaps from
tree to tree.  As for our friend the corporal, he had
changed the complexion of his outward man in a
most unexampled manner;&mdash;where he had got the
clothes furbished up for the nonce, heaven knows,
unless, indeed, which is not unlikely, they had all
along formed part of his kit on board; but there he
was, dressed in a respectable suit of black broad cloth,
a decent black beaver, and a white neckcloth; his chin
well shaven, and in the grave expression of his
countenance, I had no difficulty in discerning that
idiotically serious kind of look that a man puts on who is
conscious of having drunk a little more than he should
have done, but who struggles to conceal it.
</p>

<p>
Dogvane, in the ramble, had killed a black snake
about three feet long, which, by the writhing of its
tail, still showed signs of life, and this he kept
swinging backwards and forwards in one of his hands,
occasionally giving the little butcher a lash with it, who
answered the blow by shouts of laughter; while a
small green paroquet, that he had bought, was
perched on one of his broad shoulders, fastened by a string,
or lanyard, round its leg to the black ribbon he wore
about his hat.
</p>

<p>
The wrangle and laughter amongst them, when I
overtook them, seemed to be in consequence of the
little Spaniard insisting on skinning the eel, as he
called it, which Dogvarie resisted, on the ground that
he intended to have it preserved in spirits and sent to
his wife.  The idea of a snake of so common a
description being a curiosity at all, seemed to entertain
little Carnero astonishingly, but when the
quartermaster propounded through Lennox (whose Spanish
was a melange of schoolboy Latin, broad Scotch, and
signs, with a stray word of the language he attempted
scattered here and there, like plums in a boarding-school
pudding), that he was going to send the reptile
to his wife, he lost control of himself altogether, and
laughed until he rolled over and over, gingham coat
and all, in the dusty road.
</p>

<p>
"Culebra a su muger!&mdash;valga me dios&mdash;tabernaculo
del diablo mismo a su querida!&mdash;ha ha, ha"
(hiccup), "mandale papagayo, hombre&mdash;o piña
conservada, o algo de dulce&mdash;algo para comer&mdash;pero
serpiente!&mdash;culebra!&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!"&mdash;(A snake to your
wife!&mdash;heaven defend me&mdash;the tabernacle of the old
one himself to your sweetheart!&mdash;send her the
parrot, man&mdash;or a preserved pine-apple or some
sweetmeats&mdash;something to eat&mdash;but a serpent!&mdash;a vile
snake&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!)
</p>

<p>
Lennox now made me out, and somewhat ashamed
of the condition of his Spanish ally, he made several
attempts to get him on his legs, but Dogvane, who
seemed offended at little Pablo's fun, stood over him
grimly with his arms folded, about which the reptile
was twining, and apparently resolute in his determination
not to give him any aid or assistance whatever.
</p>

<p>
"Surge, carnifex&mdash;get up, man&mdash;surge, you
drunken beast," quoth Lennox, and then he dragged
at the little man by the arms and coat skirts, until he
got him out of the path so as to allow me to drive on.
</p>

<p>
At length he got him on his legs, and held him in
his arms.
</p>

<p>
"Thank ye, Lennox," said I.  He bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Hilloa," quoth Dogvane, startled at my appearance;
"Mr Brail, I declare!"&mdash;and he tore off his
hat with such vehemence, that the poor little paroquet,
fastened by the leg to it, was dashed into Pablo
Carnero's face.
</p>

<p>
"Marinero&mdash;animal&mdash;pendejo&mdash;quieres que yo pierdo
mis ojos, con su paxaro intierno?"&mdash;(Sailor&mdash;animal&mdash;hangman&mdash;do
you wish to knock my eyes out
with your infernal bird?) and he made at him as if
he would have annihilated him on the spot.  At this
hostile demonstration, Dogvane very coolly caught the
little man in his arms, and tossed him into the ditch,
as if he had been a ball of spun-yarn; where, as the
night is fine, we shall leave him to gather himself up
the best way he can.
</p>

<p>
It seemed little Carnero's house was the haunt of the
Batabano traders or smugglers, and that Lennox had
bargained with him for a mule, and made his little
arrangements for proceeding with a recua, or small
caravan, across the island on the following evening.
</p>

<p>
Next morning Mr Duquesné and I, accompanied
by Listado and Mr M&mdash;&mdash;, rode into the country
about five miles, on the Batabano road, to visit Mr
D&mdash;&mdash; and family at their villa.  I found M&mdash;&mdash; a
very intelligent Scotchman; indeed, in most matters
of trade he was, and I hope <i>is</i>, considered a first-rate
authority in the place.  He was a tall thin fair-haired
man, with a good deal of the Yankee in his cut and
appearance, although none whatever in his manner;
and as for his kindness I never can forget it.  Mr
D&mdash;&mdash; was an Englishman who had married a Spanish
lady; and at the time I mention, he had returned
from England with his children&mdash;a son, and several
daughters grown up&mdash;the latter with all the polish and
accomplishments of Englishwomen engrafted on the
enchanting <i>naïveté</i> of Spanish girls; and even at this
distance of time I can remember their beautifully pliant
and most graceful Spanish figures, as things that I can
dream of still, but never expect again to see; while
their clear olive complexions, large dark eyes, and
coal-black ringlets, were charms, within gunshot of
which no disengaged heart could venture, and hope to
come off scatheless.  Disengaged hearts!  Go on,
Master Benjamin Brail, I see how it is with you, my lad.
</p>

<p>
I had previously shaken hands with Lennox, whose
heart, poor fellow, between parting with me and little
Dicky Phantom, was like to burst, and did not
expect to have seen him again; but on our return from
Mr D&mdash;&mdash;'s in the evening, we met a man mounted
on a strong pacing horse, dressed as usual in a
gingham jacket and trowsers, with a large slouched hat of
plaited grass, a cloak strapped on his saddle-bow, and
a valise behind him.  He carried his trabuco, or
blunderbuss, in his right hand, resting on the cloak;
and his heels were garnished with a pair of most
persuasive silver spurs buckled over <i>shoes</i>.  His
trowsers, in the action of riding, had shuffled up to his
knees, disclosing a formidable sample of muscle in the
calf of his leg: while his gaunt brown sinewy hand,
and sun-burnt moorish-looking features, evinced that
he would, independently of his arms, have been a
tough customer to the strongest man in the Old Gazelle.
</p>

<p>
M&mdash;&mdash; and Listado both addressed this brigand-looking
subject with the greatest familiarity, and enquired
where his comrades were.  He nodded his head
backwards over his shoulder, as much as to say, "Close
behind me."  Indeed, we now heard the clattering of
mules' feet up the path, that here ascended suddenly
from the level country, and more resembled a dry
river course than a road, and the shouting of the riders
to their bestias and each other.
</p>

<p>
Presently about thirty odd-looking tailor-like
creatures appeared on stout mules, riding with their knees
up to their noses, evidently not at all at home, but
held in their seats by the old-fashioned demi-piques,
with which their animals were caparisoned.  I directed
an enquiring look at M&mdash;&mdash;.  He laughed.
</p>

<p>
"Batabano smugglers."
</p>

<p>
"What! this in the face of day?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes; those things are managed coolly enough
here, Mr Brail.  They are now on their way to the
coast, where a vessel is doubtless lying ready to carry
them over to Jamaica, and to bring them back when
they have laid out their money in goods.  See there,
those sumpter mules are laden with their bags of
doubloons; when they return to Batabano, with the
assistance of my friend Juan Nocheobscuro there, and
some of his gang, their goods will soon be in the
tiendas, or shops of Havanna, to the great injury of the
fair trader who pays duties, I will confess&mdash;and I
hope the evil will soon be put down; but there it is
for the present as you see it."
</p>

<p>
"But how comes Listado to know so many of the
tailor-looking caballeros?"
</p>

<p>
"They are all customers of ours," said he, "who
only resort to Jamaica occasionally, and are mostly
shopkeepers themselves, or have partners who are so."
</p>

<p>
"And our excellent Irish friend himself, may I
ask, who is he&mdash;is he your partner?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," said M&mdash;&mdash;, "he is not my partner, but
he is connected with most respectable Irish
correspondents of mine, who consign linens and other Irish
produce largely to my establishment, and for whom
I load several ships in the season with sugar and
coffee; so Monsieur Listado, who is rich since his father's
death (he was the head of the firm), has been sent by
the Irish house to superintend the sales of the outward
cargoes, under my auspices, and to take a sort of
general charge of shipping the returns; but," continued
he, laughing, "as you see, he does not <i>kill</i> himself by
the intensity of his application to business.  He is a
warm-hearted and light-headed Irishman,&mdash;one who
would fight <i>for</i> his friend to the last, and even with
him for pastime, if no legitimate quarrel could be
had.  We had a little bother with him at first, but as I
know him now, we get on astonishingly; and I don't
think we have had one single angry word together for
these six months past, indeed never since he found out
from my letter-book that I had once done an essential
mercantile service to his father, in protecting a large
amount of his bills drawn while he was in New York,
when dishonoured by a rascally agent at that time
employed by him here.  But who comes?"  Who indeed,
thought I, as no less a personage than Lennox
himself brought up the rear, on a stout mule, in his dingy
suit of sables; cutting a conspicuous figure amongst
the gaudily dressed Dons.  He paced steadily past us,
and when I bid him good-by, he merely touched his
hat and rode on.  Presently the whole cavalcade was
out of sight, and nothing else occurred until we
arrived at Havanna, and I found myself once more
comfortably lodged under Mr Duquesné's hospitable roof.
</p>

<p>
About a fortnight after this I received letters from
Mr Peter Brail, my uncle in Liverpool, offering me
a share in the firm, and enjoining me, if I accepted it,
to return immediately, without visiting Jamaica.  He
also stated that he had written his Kingston
correspondents, with instructions as to some business that I
was to have transacted, had I, as originally intended,
gone thither; and mentioned to them, at the same
time, the probable change in my plans.
</p>

<p>
This was too favourable an offer to be declined; I
therefore made up my mind to close with it; but, as
I could not wind up my Havanna transactions for
some time, I determined to spend the interim as
pleasantly as possible.
</p>

<p>
Two days afterwards I was invited to make one in
a cruise into the country.  Accordingly, the following
morning we were all prepared to set off to visit Mr
Hudson's estate; it was about five in the morning&mdash;we
had packed up&mdash;the volantes and horses were already
at the door, and Mrs Hudson, her daughter
Helen, with Dicky Phantom, once more in his little
kilt of a frock, in her hand; Sophie Duquesné, De
Walden, Mr Hudson, and myself, all spurred and
whipped, if not all booted, were ready in the vestibule,
waiting by candle-light for Mr Listado, who was also
to be of the party.  Gradually the day broke, and as
the servants were putting out the candles, in
compliment to Aurora's blushes, in trundled our Hibernian
friend, with his usual boisterosity.
</p>

<p>
"Hope I haven't kept you waiting, Mr Hudson?&mdash;that
villain Palotinto, the black warehouseman,
store <i>nigger</i>"&mdash;with a wink to me&mdash;"as you would
call him in New York,"&mdash;Mr Hudson laughed
good-naturedly&mdash;"got drunk, and be fiddled to him&mdash;never
swear before ladies, Brail&mdash;and forgot to call me; and
when he did wake me, he could not find my spurs,
and the mule's bridle was amissing, and the devil
knows what all had gone wrong; so I was bothered
entirely&mdash;but here I am, my charmers, large as life,
and as agreeable as ever&mdash;don't you think so, Miss
Hudson?"  She laughed; and as the blundering
blockhead dragged, rather than handed her towards
her volante, I felt a slight comical kind of I
don't-know-what, and a bit of a tiny flutter, not a thousand
miles from my heart.&mdash;"Ho, ho," thought I, Benjie.
"But what an ass you were not to hand her out
your&mdash;&mdash;.  Death and the devil, what does the
mouldy potato mean?"&mdash;continued I to myself, as
Listado, after fumbling to get the step of the
New-York built voiture out, and knocking the Moreno, or
brown driver, down on his nose for attempting to help
him, desecrated the sweet little body's slender waist
with his rough arms, and actually lifted her, laughing
and giggling (<i>skirling</i>, to borrow from Lennox),
bodily into the carriage.
</p>

<p>
Somehow I took little note for a considerable time
after this how the rest of us were bestowed, until I
found myself in company with Listado, De Walden,
and Mr Hudson, on horseback, without well knowing
how I got there, followed by a cavalcade of six
negroes, on mules, with two sumpter ones with
luggage, and three led small Spanish barbs, with side
saddles, all curveting in the wake of the carriage with
the ladies, by this time trundling through the city gate,
a cable's length a-head of us.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Benjie Brail," shouted Listado, "have you
become a mendicant friar, that you travel without
your hat"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My hat?" said I, deucedly taken aback and annoyed;
"true enough&mdash;how very odd and foolish&mdash;I say,
Nariz de Niéve, do oblige me, and ride back for my
sombrero."
</p>

<h4>
A CRUISE IN THE MOUNTAINS&mdash;&mdash;EL CAFETAL.[<a id="chap04fn1text"></a><a href="#chap04fn1">1</a>]

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap04fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap04fn1text">1</a>] <i>Cafetal</i>&mdash;Coffee estate.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We arrived, at five in the afternoon, at Mr Hudson's
property, having stopped, during the heat of the
day, under a large deserted shed, situated in the
middle of a most beautiful grass plat, and overshadowed
by splendid trees.  A rill of clear cold water ran past,
in which we cooled our liqueurs; and the substantial
lunch we made, enabled all of us to hold out gallantly
until our journey was finished.  The road at one time
had wound along the margin of the sea; at another it
diverged inland amongst tree-covered knolls, and at
every turn one was refreshed by splashing through a
crystal-clear stream.
</p>

<p>
Towards the afternoon we appeared to have made
a longer detour, and to have struck farther into the
country than we had hitherto done.  We passed several
sugar estates, and then came to a large new settled
coffee property, with the bushes growing amongst
the fire-scathed stumps of the recently felled trees
(up which the yam vines twisted luxuriantly, as if
they had been hop-poles), loaded with red berries,
that glanced like ripe cherries amongst the leaves,
dark and green as those of the holly.  We had just
been greeted by the uncouth shouts of a gang of
newly imported Africans, that under white superintendents
were cultivating the ground, when Listado's
horse suddenly started and threw him, as he rode
ahead of us pioneering the way for the ladies, who were
by this time mounted on their ponies, the volante
having been left at the estate below.  He fell amidst a
heap of withered plantain suckers, which crashed under
him,&mdash;in an instant a hundred vultures, hideous
creatures, with heads as naked of feathers as a
turkey-cock, the body being about the same size, flew up with
a loud rushing noise, and a horrid concert of croaking,
from the carcass of a bullock they were devouring, that
lay right in the path, and which had startled the horse.
We were informed by one of the superintendents that
the creature had only died the night before; although
by the time we saw it, there was little remaining but
the bones&mdash;indeed half a dozen of the obscene birds
were at work like quarrymen in the cavity of the ribs.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Listado, dear," said I, "you made an empty
saddle of it very cleverly&mdash;no wax there&mdash;why you
shot out like a sky-rocket&mdash;but never mind, I hope
you are not hurt?"
</p>

<p>
He laughed louder than any of us, and again pricked
a-head as zealously as before.  The Patlander was at
this time making sail past Dicky Phantom, who was
strapped on to a chair, that a negro had slung at his
back, knapsack fashion, and who kept way with us,
go as fast as we chose, apparently without the least
inconvenience.
</p>

<p>
"I tink, Mr Listado," said the child to our friend,
as he pushed a-head to resume his station in the
van&mdash;"I tink you wantee jomp upon de back of one
of dem big crow, Mr Listado.  Horse must hurt you
some place, so you want ride upon big turkey, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"You <i>tink</i>, you tiny little rascal, you! who put
that quip in your head?"
</p>

<p>
"Mamma Hudson, Miss Helen tell me say so."
</p>

<p>
"Bah," quoth Lorenzo, and shoved on.
</p>

<p>
"Hold hard," I shouted, as the road dipped abruptly
into the recesses of the natural forest; and I pulled
up, for fear of my mule stumbling or running me
against a tree, or one of my companions; so sudden
had the change been from the fierce blaze of the sun
in the cleared ground, to the dark green twilight of
the wood.  However, although the trees, as we rode
on, grew higher, and their intertwined branches
became even more thickly woven together, and the
matted leaves overhead more impervious to the light
and heat, yet we all quickly became so accustomed
to the dark shade that we very soon saw every thing
distinctly.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, ladies," quoth Listado, as they
dawned on him in all their loveliness; "how do you
do?  I have not seen you for some time&mdash;do you
know, the beautiful verdure of your cheeks, in this
light, is quite entirely captivating.  You would be the
envy of all the mermaids of the ocean if they saw
you&mdash;but I believe they are not given to walk much in
woods.  Miss Hudson's beautiful face is of a cool
refreshing pea-green, as I am a gentleman; and her
fair nose of the colour of a grey parrot's bill, or an
unboiled lobster's claw,&mdash;as for Mademoiselle
Duquesné&mdash;may I die an ould maid, if you are not a
delicate shade darker&mdash;and look if the child don't look
as green as a fairy.  Did ever mortal man see such a
shamrock of a picanniny?  But it is past meridian&mdash;stop
till I take an observation."&mdash;Here our noisy friend
put a bottle of vin-de-grave to his head.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know," said he, "I really require a cordial
after my ground and lofty tumbling amongst those
very damnable craturs, the turkey buzzards down
below there."
</p>

<p>
"Very true," said Miss Hudson; "and I presume,
Mr Listado, since you are dealing in nicknames, and
have already ran through all the shades of your national
colour, you will not fire, if we call you Mr Bottlegreen."
</p>

<p>
"Fair enough that same, Helen&mdash;Fire!&mdash;why, I
have half a mind to shoot you with this bottle of soda
water," taking one from his holster&mdash;"if I could only
get the string loosened&mdash;Ah, Miss Hudson, would
that my heart strings were as tough."  And he made
a most lamentable face, as if his interior was
disarranged, and heaved a sigh fit to turn the sails of a
windmill.
</p>

<p>
"There he goes with his mock sentimentality
again," cried the sweet girl, laughing.
</p>

<p>
We rode on, the ground becoming more rugged and
rocky at every step, but perfectly clear of underwood&mdash;the
dry grey limestone rocks increasing and shooting
up all round us, like pinnacles, or Druidical
monuments: but still immense trees found nourishment
enough in the black mould amongst the fissures, dry
as they appeared to be, and the shade continued as
deep as ever; while, as the afternoon wore on, the
musquittoes increased most disagreeably.
</p>

<p>
"Look at these two guanas chasing each other up
that tree," shouted Listado; "what horrid ugly things
they are.  I declare that large one is three feet long
from stem to stern, as friend Benjie there would have
said."  As we all stopped to look at the hideous
lizard, it seemed to think, on the principle of fair play,
that it might take a squint at us, and accordingly came
to a stand-still on a branch, about three fathoms above
where the negro stood with little Dicky on his back.
</p>

<p>
"What ugly beast," quoth the little fellow, as he
lay back and looked up at it&mdash;a musket shot at this
instant was fired close to us from the wood&mdash;the sharp
report shattering from tree to rock, until it rattled to
rest in tiny echoes in the distance.  At first we all
started, and then peered anxiously about us, but we
could only see a thin white puff of smoke rise and
blow off through a small break or vista in the forest,
and smell the gunpowder&mdash;we could perceive no one.  I
looked up, the guana had been wounded, as it was now
clinging to the branch with its two hind feet and its
long tail, and fiercely biting and tearing its side with
its fore claws, as it hung with its head downwards, and
swung and struggled about in agony.  I made sure this
was the spot where the bullet had struck it, and just
as the negro who had fired, a sort of gamekeeper of
Mr Hudson's, appeared at the top of the path, the
dragon-looking lizard dropped right down on poor little
Dicky Phantom, as he sat lashed into his chair, unable
to escape.  Here was the devil to pay with a vengeance.
The child shrieked, as the abominable reptile twined
and twisted about him, with its snake-like tail, and
formidable claws, and threatening him with its
crocodile looking snout.  I saw it bite him on the
arm&mdash;this was the signal for the women to scream, and
Listado to swear, and for me to seize the creature by the
tail, and endeavour to drag him away&mdash;but I was
terrified to use force, lest I should lacerate poor
Dicky&mdash;while the negro, who carried the child, became
frantic with fright, and jumped and yelled amongst
the trees, like an ourang-outang bitten by a rattlesnake.
The guana still kept his hold of the child,
however, making a chattering noise between its teeth,
like that of a small monkey, when Listado came up to
me&mdash;"Stop, Brail, give me"&mdash;and he twitched the
animal away with a jerk, and the sleeve of Dicky's
frock in its teeth; but it instantly fastened on his own
leg, and if the black game-keeper had not, with more
presence of mind than any one of us possessed, come
up, and forcibly choked the creature off with his bare
hands, although he thereby got several severe scratches,
he might have been seriously injured.  However, it
turned out that the damage was not very serious after
all, little Dicky having been more frightened than
hurt, as the guana's teeth had fastened in his clothes,
and not in his flesh, so we all soon got into sailing
condition again, and proceeded on our way.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, the road abutted on a high white wall,
the trees growing close up to it, without any previous
indications of cleared ground or habitation.  This
was the back part of Mr Hudson's house, which
stood on the very edge of the forest we had come
through.  It was a large stone edifice of two stories,
plastered and white-washed, built in the shape of a
square, with a court in the centre, and galleries on
both floors all round the inside, after the pattern of
the houses of the nobility in Old Spain, especially in
the Moorish towns.  We alighted at a large arched
gateway, and having given our horses to two black
servants that were in attendance, entered the court,
where the taste of the American ladies shone conspicuous.
</p>

<p>
In the centre there was a deep basin, hewn roughly,
I should rather say ruggedly, out of the solid rock,
and filled with the purest and most limpid water.
Several large plantain suckers grew on the edge of it, in
artificial excavations in the stone, to the height of
twenty feet, so that their tops were on a level with the
piazza above; and a fountain or jet of water was forced
up from the centre of the pool, in a whizzing shower,
amongst their broad and jagged leaves, whereon the
large drops of moisture rolled about with every motion,
like silver balls on green velvet.  Beneath the
proverbially cool shade of these plantain suckers, a
glorious living mosaic of most beautiful flowers,
interspersed with myrtle and other evergreens, filled the
parterre, which was divided into small lozenges by
tiny hedges of young box and lime bushes; while the
double jessamine absolutely covered the pillars of the
piazza, as I have seen ivy clinging round the columns
of a ruined temple, scattering its white leaves like
snow-flakes at every gush of the breeze; yet all these
glorious plants and flowers grew out of the scanty
earth that filled the crevices of the rock, seemingly
depending more on the element of water than on the
soil.  Every thing in the centre of the small square
appeared so natural, so devoid of that art, largely
employed, yet skilfully masked, that I never would have
tired gloating on it.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Master Hudson," quoth Listado, "you
have made two" [pronouncing it <i>tew</i>] "small
mistakes here.  First, you have the trees too near the
house, which brings the plague of musquittoes upon
you; secondly, this fountain, how pretty soever to look
at, must make the domicile confoundedly damp, and all
your capital New York cheeses prematurely mouldy.
I declare," feeling his chin, "I am growing mouldy
myself, or half of my beard has been left unreaped by
that villanous razor of Brail's there, that I scraped
with this morning&mdash;shaving I could not call it."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," said I, "the fountain is beautiful,
and don't blame the razor until you have a better of
your own."
</p>

<p>
"It is, indeed, beautiful," said Mrs Hudson; "but,
alas! that such a paradise should not be fenced against
the demon of yellow fever!"
</p>

<p>
The supply of water to the basin of the said
fountain, by the way, which came from the neighbouring
hill; wras so ample, that it forced the jet from a
crater-like aperture in the bottom, without the aid of
pipe or tube of any kind, full six feet above the
surface in a solid cone, or cube, of two feet in diameter;
and the spray some eight feet higher.  No one who
has lived in such a climate, and witnessed such a
scene, can ever forget the delicious rushing, and
splashing, and sparkling of the water, and the rustling,
or rather pattering, of the plantain leaves, and of
the bushes, as the breeze stirred them.
</p>

<p>
The lower gallery was paved with small diamond-shaped
slabs of blue and white marble, the very look
of which added to the coolness.  "Why, Mr Hudson,
how glorious! nothing superior to this even in
<i>ould</i> Ireland."
</p>

<p>
The American laughed, and nodded in the direction
of his daughter.  I turned my eye in the same
direction, and met hers.  She had apparently been
observing how I was affected, at least so my vanity
whispered: she blushed slightly, and looked another way.
</p>

<p>
I saw I must say something.  "Indeed, Miss
Hudson, I thought you had not been above two
months in the island.  Did you not come down in
the American frigate"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
She smiled.
</p>

<p>
"I did, Mr Brail; but it was the cruise before
last&mdash;we have been six months here."
</p>

<p>
"Six months! and are all these glorious plants
the growth of six months?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, that they are," quoth Listado; "most of
them have not been planted more than <i>six weeks</i>."
</p>

<p>
The inside of this large mansion was laid out more
for comfort than show; the rooms, that all opened
into the corridors already mentioned, were large and
airy, but, with the exception of a tolerable
dining-room, drawing-room, and the apartments of the
ladies, very indifferently furnished.  They were lit
from without by the usual heavy wooden unglazed
balconies, common both in New and Old Spain, which
appear to have been invented more for the purpose of
excluding the heat than admitting the light.
</p>

<p>
In front of the house, and on each side, were large
white terraced platforms, with shallow stone ledges,
built in flights, like gigantic stairs on the hillside.
On this the coffee was thickly strewed in the red
husk, or pulp, as it is called, to dry in the sun.
Little Dicky took the berries to be cherries, until the
pulp stuck in his little teeth.
</p>

<p>
The opposite hill had been cleared, and was
covered with coffee-bushes; and right below us, in the
bottom of the deep ravine, a tree-screened rivulet
murmured and brawled alternately over a rugged bed
of limestone rock, as the breeze rose and fell.
</p>

<p>
In the northernmost nook of the cleared field, the
negro houses, as usual surrounded with palm,
star-apple, and orange trees, were clustered below an
overhanging rock like eagles' nests, with blue threads of
smoke rising up from them in still spiral jets, until it
reached the top of the breezy cliff that sheltered
them, when it suddenly blew off, and was dissipated.
Beyond these lay a large field of luxuriant guinea
grass, covered with bullocks and mules, like black
dottings on the hillside.  In every other direction one
unbroken forest prevailed; the only blemish on the
fair face of nature was man: for although the negroes
that we saw at work appeared sleek and fat, yet, being
most of them fresh from the ship, there was a savageness
in the expression of their countenances, and in
their half-naked bodies, that had nothing Arcadian in it.
</p>

<p>
We were all, especially the ladies, pretty well tired;
so, after a comfortable dinner, we betook ourselves
to rest betimes.  Next morning, at seven o'clock, we
again mustered in force in the breakfast room, and
the instant I entered, little Dicky, to my surprise,
bolted from Helen Hudson's side, dashing away her
hand from him angrily, and ran to me&mdash;"Massa
Brail, Miss Hudson tell lie."
</p>

<p>
"Dicky, mind what you say."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes; but yesterday she say&mdash;Dicky Phantom,
you put on petticoat and frock&mdash;to-morrow you
put on trowsers again."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Dicky, Dicky," cried Helen, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"Well, my dear boy, Miss Hudson must be as
good as her word, and restore your trowsers: she
does not mean to <i>wear</i> them, does she?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Dicky, Helen did quite right to dress
you as you are," said Mrs Hudson, perceiving her
daughter a little put out; "your little trowsers were
all tar and pitch, and you are too young to leave off
frocks yet."
</p>

<p>
The child, although there was no help at hand,
determined to show he would not be imposed on, so,
like a little snake casting his skin, he deliberately
shook himself, and with a wriggle of his shoulders
slid out of his clothes altogether; and there he stood
like a little naked Cupidon&mdash;"Now I shall go and
catch fis," said the little fellow laughing.  With that
he toddled away into the basin of water, that was
gurgling and splashing in the court-yard.  I wish
there had been a painter to have caught the group.
Sophie Duquesné and Helen Hudson running about
the small walks of the rocky parterre, dashing the
water spangles from the flowers with their light feet,
and laughing loudly as they strove to catch Dicky,
who kept just beyond their reach, squealing with
child-like joy, and splashing them: a perfect shower
of spray descending all the time on the beautiful
urchin's own curly pate; while the plantain leaves
were shaking in the breeze, and checkering the blue
sky overhead.  At length De Walden caught him, and
swung him out of the water by the arms into Helen
Hudson's lap.
</p>

<p>
When breakfast was over, we again mounted our
mules, to explore the neighbourhood towards the
coast; for notwithstanding the tortuosity of the road
we had come, we were not, Mr Hudson said, above three
miles distant from the sea after all.  Listado, honest
gentleman, chose to mount the smallest mule that
could be had; and as he was upwards of six feet high,
he looked, as he paced along, more like an automaton
mounted on a velocipede than any thing else.
</p>

<p>
After riding along for half an hour, in a path cut
through the otherwise impervious wood, we came to
a naked, storm-scathed, and sun-baked promontory of
red clay and grey stone, which beetled over the sea so
abruptly, that the line of vision struck the water at
least a mile beyond the beach, which was thus
entirely hid from our sight.  The spot where we
stood seemed to be the eastern headland, or cape, of a
small and most beautiful bay, which opened to our
view down to leeward.  Beyond us, out at sea, the
water was roughened by a fiery sea-breeze&mdash;to use
the West Indian phrase&mdash;the blue water being thickly
speckled with white crests; and from the speed with
which the white sails in the offing slid along their
liquid way, like feathers, or snow-flakes floating down
the wind, it might be called a brisk gale.  Every
now and then a tiny white speck would emerge from
under the bluff into sight, and skim away until lost in
the misty distance; and a coaster from the offing, as
she hauled in for the bay, would as suddenly vanish
for a time, until she again appeared, diminished in
the distance to a sea-bird, gliding slowly along the
glasslike surface of the small bay, when she would
fold her white wings, and become stationary at
anchor near the shipping-place, or Barquedier, as it is
called.
</p>

<p>
"We must go down and see that beautiful bay,
Helen&mdash;Miss Hudson, I mean&mdash;beg pardon"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"We have not time, Mr Brail, to-day; we must
return, as my father wishes us to visit some beautiful
scenery in the woods; but we shall ride to it another
forenoon&mdash;only, why will you distress yourself about
calling me Helen&mdash;why, I <i>am</i> Helen&mdash;every body calls
me Helen&mdash;with your precise <i>Miss</i> Hudson, and
<i>Mademoiselle</i> Duquesné.  If you stick to such
formalities, I will positively treat you to a few <i>calculations</i>
and <i>guessings</i>."  Here the laughing girl gave the
true nasal twang of Jonathan himself.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well&mdash;agreed&mdash;Helen you shall be&mdash;my
Helen."  She looked at me, and blushing, held up
her finger, and shook her head&mdash;as if she had
said&mdash;"No, no,&mdash;not quite <i>yet</i>."  My heart stopped a beat
to gather strength, and then gave such a devil of a
bounce&mdash;"Hillo," thought I&mdash;"Ha, ha, Master Benjamin!"
</p>

<p>
We therefore returned homewards, and having
extended our ride in another direction, and been
highly gratified by the scenery, we found ourselves
seated at dinner, in the lower piazza of the court
facing the east, so as to be screened from the rays of
the setting sun by the roof of the house.
</p>

<p>
The water of the clear pool in the centre of the
yard was led away, on the side we sat on, in a little
canal, amongst the rocks, out of which it was hewn,
and this was thickly planted with lotuses.  We had
dined, and the golden sky overhead began to be
spangled with a bright silver star here and there, and
the distant and scarcely perceptible buzz of a solitary
scout of a musquitto, would every now and then
suddenly increase to a loud singing noise, as he
reconnoitred your auricle&mdash;presently you heard the hum
of a whole picket of them&mdash;the advanced guard of a
host of winged pests, which were thus giving token
of the approach of evening.
</p>

<p>
"Master Hudson," quoth Listado again&mdash;"you have
a beautiful situation here, certainly; magnificent
scenery, and a good house; fine water, and pure air&mdash;but
a damnable quantity of musquittoes&mdash;beg, pardon,
ladies, for the lapse&mdash;yet really, just as I am expatiating,
one of those devils has flown into my eye,
half-a-dozen into my mouth, and&mdash;Lord, if a big fellow
has not got into my ear, and is at this identical
moment thundering away at the timpanum, ay, as if
he were a bass drummer!"  Here our friend started
up, and began to dance about and shake his head, as
if he would have cast it from his shoulders into the pool.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Brail," said Helen, laughing, as soon as the
Irishman had subsided&mdash;"do you see how carefully
those beautiful water-lilies have folded up their silver
leaves before retiring to their watery pillows?&mdash;there,
that one nearest your foot has already sunk below
the water; and the largest, that is still gently moved
by the small ripple that radiates from the splashing
water in the middle of the basin, will soon follow&mdash;See,
it is gone"&mdash;as, one by one, the whole of the
beautiful plants gradually sank under the surface for
the night.
</p>

<p>
I was struck with this, and fascinated by the tone
and manner of the speaker;&mdash;when suddenly the
lotuses again emerged.
</p>

<p>
"Heyday," said De Walden&mdash;"your poetry is all
lost, Miss Hudson; the flowers don't seem to sleep
sound on the watery pillows you spoke of&mdash;they are
as gallant and complimentary as Don Lorenzo there;
for see, they are all back to have another peep at you."
</p>

<p>
"Probably they found their beds were not made,
De Walden," rapped out Listado.
</p>

<p>
"Very extraordinary; what can that mean?" said
Sophie Duquesné.
</p>

<p>
"My dear Miss Duquesné," said Listado, "I see I
must give you some lessons in pronunciation still&mdash;why
will you worry your R's so in your beautiful
throat?"
</p>

<p>
"It is my French accent, you know, and I cannot
help it," said the lovely creature, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"But really what <i>is</i> this?" said Helen; and as she
spoke, the jet gradually became weaker and weaker;
the water in the pool rapidly subsided for a minute;
and then, with a loud, gurgling noise, disappeared
altogether, leaving the rocky bed dry, and the poor
pet mountain-mullets walloping amongst the
water-plants like so many silver wedges.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," shouted Listado, in extreme surprise&mdash;"Hillo,
who has stolen our purling stream?&mdash;what
the devil has become of the river, Master Hudson?"  This
was a thing neither Mr Hudson nor any one
else could tell&mdash;that it had absolutely vanished as
described was clear enough; but just as the girls and
De Walden had secured the fish in a tub, the basin
was again filled, as suddenly as it had been emptied,
with the same loud gurgle, too, and in ten minutes
one could not have told that any thing had happened.
</p>

<p>
"There must have been some subterranean convulsions
to produce this phenomenon," said I.
</p>

<p>
"No doubt of it," rejoined Listado&mdash;"Old Nicholas
had run short of water for his tay, and borrowed
our beautiful jet for a little&mdash;but, hush! he has heard
me, so sure as peas are pays in Ireland, and has
turned off the water again&mdash;Hush!"
</p>

<p>
It once more disappeared in the same manner, and
with the same loud, gurgling noise as before; but
after the basin was dry this time, we distinctly heard
several distant reports, in the bowels of the earth,
like the far-off reverberations of a cannon-shot
amongst the hills.
</p>

<p>
"There was no earthquake?" said Mr Hudson,
looking round enquiringly, after we had a little
recovered from our surprise&mdash;no one had perceived it if
there had been.  "I should not be surprised if this
be the precursor of one, however," he continued,
"after this long drought and intense heat."
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
The following evening was the one we had fixed
on, according to previous arrangement, to ride to the
beautiful bay lying within the promontory already
described.
</p>

<p>
The weather, as already hinted, for several weeks
preceding this had been uncommonly hot, even for that
climate; and the earth was parched and rent by intense
drought.  In many places in our rides we came upon
fissures a foot wide, and several fathoms deep; and the
trees had, in general, assumed the hue of our English
leaves in November.  There had been several
"temblores de tierra," or shocks of earthquake, within this
period&mdash;slight at first, but they seemed to increase in
strength and frequency, as the dry weather continued;
and it was therefore reasonable to refer the sudden
disappearing of the jet of water to some internal
convulsion of this nature.
</p>

<p>
On the day in question there was not a cloud to be
seen&mdash;a hot blending blue blaze hung over the land
and water, through which every object trembled as if
the earth and sea had sent up a thin smoke through
intensity of heat.
</p>

<p>
The sun when he rose, and until high up in
heaven, had the same red magnified disk, as in a foggy
winter morning in England; and a lurid purple hue
pervaded all nature, as if he had been suffering a
temporary eclipse; while the usual sea breeze entirely
failed.
</p>

<p>
About noon every thing was deadly still,&mdash;the cattle
had betaken themselves to the small river, where they
stood listlessly chewing their cuds, as if overpowered by
the density of the air.  Not a bird was hopping in the
no longer vocal trees; the very lizards were still: the
negroes employed in cleaning the coffee pieces worked
in silence, in place of shouting and laughing, and
gabbling to each other, as is their wont&mdash;and when the
driver or black superintendent gave his orders, the
few words he uttered sounded loud and hollow,
echoing from hill to hill.  I could hear distinctly what he
said on the opposite mountain side, situated above a
mile off, although I was persuaded at the same time
that he spoke in his natural tone, and with no greater
exertion than he used in common conversation.  The
very clink of the negroes' hoes in the rocky soil was
unaccountably distinct and sharp.
</p>

<p>
Several inexplicable noises had been heard during
the forenoon from the head of the ravine; and once
or twice a strong rushing sound, like the wind amongst
trees, passed over our heads, although there was not
a zephyr moving; a poet might have fancied it
cohorts of invisible spirits charging each other in the
air.  At other times, a gradually increasing
subterraneous grumbling noise would spring up, at first
undistinguishable from distant thunder, but coming
apparently nearer, it would end in a series of
deadened reports, like a distant cannonade; and this again
would be followed by a sharp hissing or hurtling in
the sky, altogether different from the rushing noise
already described; more resembling that made by
streamers in a high latitude, or the flight of a
congreve rocket than any thing else.  But the most
startling sound of all was the solitary wild cry of a
crane, now and then; resembling for all the world
the high note of a trumpet, blown short and quick.
</p>

<p>
We had all been puzzling ourselves with these
appearances and strange noises during the forenoon,&mdash;some
arguing that a hurricane was impending, others
that they betokened an earthquake; but the stillness
continued without either occurring, and the day wore
on very much as usual.
</p>

<p>
In the evening, the sun was again shorn of his
flaming beams, as he sank in the west, and became
magnified as in the morning, when he dipped in the
haze near the horizon, into a broad moonlike globe.
</p>

<p>
"Come," said our excellent host, "we have had no
exercise to-day, I calculate, so let us order the mules,
and ride to Helen's beautiful bay, that she raves
about; we shall at least breathe fresher air there."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, papa, I don't <i>rave</i> about it," said she; "it is
only Sophia and Mr Listado who <i>rave</i>;" whereupon
the ladies vanished, but soon reappeared all
ready, when we mounted and set off.
</p>

<p>
By the time we reached the eastern cape, or headland
of the small bay, the sun, near his setting, had
tinged the whole calm sea, as far as the eye could
reach, with a bluish purple.  The stars appeared larger
than usual; some of them surrounded with tiny haloes;
and the planet Venus, as she struggled up in the east,
loomed like a small moon.
</p>

<p>
We wound downwards along a zig-zag path, hewn
out of the rock, until we arrived at the beautiful white
beach, which we had admired so much from above.

<p>
The swell from the offing tumbled in towards the
land, in long purple undulations, and as it broke on
the rocky coast beyond the promontory, the noise was
like the distant roar of a populous town, borne on the
swell of the breeze.  In the bay itself, however, all was
still; the surface of the sea clear and calm as a mirror.
The sun was still visible to us, but already every thing
was in shade on the opposite side of the anchorage&mdash;here
about a quarter of a mile across, where the dark
trees and bushes were reflected with startling
distinctness: There was no ascertaining the water line in
that direction, as the bank was high and precipitous,
and the foliage darkened down to the very water's
edge; on our side, at the head of the bay, there was
a small wooden wharf that ran into the sea, alongside
of which lay a shallop with her sails hoisted, but
hanging motionless in the dead calm, from the spars.  A
solitary negro was walking slowly up and down this
erection, smoking; his shadow in the water looking
like his <i>doppel ganger</i>, or a familiar spirit.  There
was a large schooner lying right in the centre of the
bay, very heavily rigged, and apparently armed, but I
could see no one on deck at first; presently,
however, there was a bustle on board of her, and two
boats were hoisted out.
</p>

<p>
"What schooner is that?" I asked Mr Hudson&mdash;he
did not know&mdash;it must be some coaster he thought.
</p>

<p>
"It cannot be that they are startled at our appearance,
surely," said Helen; "yet it looks like it."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nonsense!" cried Don Lorenzo&mdash;"a drogger
waiting for coffee; a drogger, Miss Hudson, believe me."
</p>

<p>
But I was not sure of this, for all at once, under
the cliff on the opposite side, we heard the sound of a
hammer, and could see a forge at work, by the sparks
that rose up like clouds of fire-flies, and the sudden
jets of light that glanced on the water: flashing on the
hairy chest and muscular arms of a swarthy-looking
fellow, naked all to his trowsers, who was busily
employed with his hammer, and on the dingy figure of a
negro that worked the bellows for him.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="poem">
  "When Vulcan forged the bolts of Jove,"<br />
</p>

<p>
sang Listado, but the sound of his own voice in the
unnatural stillness, startled both himself and us, and
he broke off abruptly.  Next moment the flame of
the forge disappeared, the clink of the hammer, and
the creaking and puffing of the bellows ceased.  A
boat now put off from the schooner, and pulled in
the direction of the forge.
</p>

<p>
From the clash and tinkling of the materials, as
they were taken on board, it was evident that the
whole apparatus had been hurriedly dismounted.
</p>

<p>
"I really do believe that we are the cause of all
this bustle," said De Walden; "that schooner is
deuced like the craft I have been accustomed to see
employed as slavers."
</p>

<p>
When the people returned towards the schooner,
we heard a voice from the brake close to us, as of some
one weak from disease, hail them to make haste and
come for him, as the person speaking "did not like
the look of the weather."  This made us all start&mdash;but
we saw no one until the boat touched the beach,
when a tall figure in the dress of a Spanish seaman,
walked slowly from the wood, got on board apparently
with great difficulty; and the boat pushed off.
</p>

<p>
I noticed De Walden start as the man pushed past.
The instant they got on board, another anchor was let
go, topmasts and yards were struck, and had down on
deck, boats were hoisted in, and other precautions
were doubtless taking, from the bustle we heard, which
we could not see, to ensure her riding easily through
the coming night.  Soon all was still again.  The
fire-flies now began to sparkle amongst the trees, when, as
we turned to reascend the path by which we had come,
De Walden whispered me, in an agitated voice,&mdash;"That
was the man that stabbed you, as sure as I live."
</p>

<p>
"The devil!" said I, turning suddenly round in
my saddle, as if I had expected him to jump up
behind me; "but come, don't let us alarm the party."
</p>

<p>
Mr Hudson here said he thought the water of the bay
trembled, and that the stars twinkled in it, but before
I perceived any thing it was again calm as glass.
Presently several fish leaped out, as if startled, shattering
the surface into circling and sparkling ripples; others
skimmed on the top with an arrowy rush, their heads
above water, and several owls broke from the shelter
of the bushes opposite with a hoarse screech, rustling
among the leaves, and after a struggling and noisy
flutter at the start, flitted across to us; ruffling the
glass-like bay with the breezy winnowing of their wings.
</p>

<p>
"What can all this mean?" said Listado.  "Did
you perceive any thing, Brail?"
</p>

<p>
He was standing beside his mule as he spoke, but
none of the rest of us had dismounted.
</p>

<p>
"No; did you?"
</p>

<p>
"I thought there was a slight shock of an earthquake
just now; but you might not have felt it from
being mounted.  There, listen!"
</p>

<p>
A rushing, as of a mighty wind, the same kind of
mysterious sound that we had heard from the wood
in the morning, now breezed up in the distance once
more; mingled with which, a report like a distant
cannon shot was every now and then heard.
</p>

<p>
It was evident that some tremendous manifestation
of the power of the Invisible was at hand; but none
of us moved.  Some unaccountable fascination held
us riveted to the spot.  We were all spell-bound.
What, indeed, was the use of flight?  Where could we
have hid ourselves from Him, to whom the darkness
is as the noonday, and whose power pervades all space?
The water in the bay now began to ebb suddenly,
until it retired about twenty paces, leaving a broad
white sandy beach where before there had been but
a narrow stripe of pebbles.  In another moment it
again rushed in with a loud <i>shaling</i> noise&mdash;I coin
the word for the sound&mdash;in <i>bores</i> nearly ten feet
high, and thundered against the rocks, with a violence
as if it had been the swell of the everlasting deep,
hove by a storm against their iron ribs; and flashing
up in white smoke all round us and over us.  The
very next moment, a huge mass of the grey cliff
above was disruptured, and thundering with increasing
bounds, pitched right over our heads (distinctly
visible between us and the sky), a pistol-shot into the
sea, where it dashed its shadow in the water into
fragments, as it fell with a flash like fire; rotten branches
and sand showered down in all directions; the dew
was shaken like a fall of diamonds from the trees, the
schooner's crew shouted, birds and beasts screamed
and bellowed, and the mules we rode started and
reared as the earth quaked beneath their feet, and
yelled forth the most unearthly sounds that ever
issued from the throat of quadruped.  The shallop at
the wharf was hove bodily forward on the crest of a
tremendous sea, like a moving mountain, and then
dashed on the shore; the schooner first dragged her
anchors by the sudden and tumultuous ebb, and then
drove with inconceivable violence against the wharf,
where I thought she would have been stranded; but
the retiring surge again floated her back, and the next
minute she was fast drifting out of the bay.  She had
parted both cables.
</p>

<p>
We hastened home, where we found every thing
in great confusion.  The house was filled with dust,
the walls and roof cracked in many places, and the
wooden frames of the windows in two instances forced
from their embrasures by the sinking of the walls.
The field negroes were crowding round in great
dismay, and the house servants were no less so; but,
amidst all this hubbub&mdash;lo!&mdash;the beautiful fountain
was once more bubbling, and hissing, and splashing
in its rocky basin, and amongst the leaves, as cheerily
as if it had never intermitted at all.
</p>

<p>
"The old one has slaked his thirst.  You see we
have got back our purling stream again, Mr Hudson,"
said Listado.
</p>

<p>
The ladies immediately retired, their nerves having
been desperately shaken; and I for one was right glad
to follow their example.  Before we males retired,
however, we had a long discussion, as to the possibility
or impossibility of the suspicious chap we had
seen at the bay being Adderfang; who at the
moment ought to have been in prison at Havanna.  De
Walden continued thoroughly persuaded of his
identity; but, at the same time, could not conceal his
lingering kindness for him.  So we finally determined
to let the villain alone, if it really, against all
probability, were he, so far as we were concerned.
</p>

<p>
On the following forenoon, we once more took the
road to Havanna.  On starting, it came to be my
lot, purely by accident, of course, to assist Miss
Hudson to mount her mule, and in the action it was
equally natural to squeeze her hand a little.  I <i>thought</i>
the squeeze was returned; and "hilloa!" said I to
myself again.
</p>

<p>
The evening following our return Mrs Hudson
gave a small party; and, recollecting the transaction
of the former day, as I took my partner's hand in the
dance, for by another accident Miss Hudson was the
lady, I thought I would see whether I was mistaken
or not; so I tried the telegraph again, and gave her
fair hand a gentle but <i>significant</i> pressure this time.
By heaven! it was now returned beyond all doubt,&mdash;and
I started, and blushed, and fidgeted, as if the
whole room had seen the squeeze, while a thrill of
pleasure&mdash;no, not pleasure; of&mdash;of&mdash;phoo, what does
it signify; but it was something very funny and
delightful at any rate.  I looked at the fair little woman,
and, as if to make assurance doubly sure, I saw the
eloquent blood mantling in her cheek, and tinging her
lovely neck like the early dawn in June.
</p>

<p>
"Oh Lord!  I am a done man; quite finished for
ever and aye."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Brail, what the deuce are you after?"
shouted Listado, as he thundered against me in a
furious <i>poussette</i>.  "You are in every body's way, and
your own too; mind, man, mind."
</p>

<p>
With that he again floundered past me with his
partner, a bouncing girl, the daughter of an American
merchant of the place, contriving in their complex
twirlifications not only to tread heavily on my toes
with his own hoofs, but to hop his partner repeatedly
over the same unfortunate members.
</p>

<p>
Nothing worth recording happened after this event
for three weeks; or, rather, I thought nothing
unconnected with it of any the smallest importance, until
Mr Hudson one morning at breakfast asked Listado,
who had just entered, and who was a very frequent
visitor, if he had ever heard any thing more of Adderfang?
</p>

<p>
"Yes; De Walden and I have just heard very
surprising things of him.  Tell it, De Walden; I have
had such a long walk this morning that I am very
sharp set.  Coffee, if you please; Brail, some of that
fowl.&mdash;So&mdash;Now, De Walden, about Adderfang&mdash;you
have nearly breakfasted, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Come, De Walden," said I; "let us hear the
story, since we can get nothing out of Listado there."
</p>

<p>
"Out of me, Brail? you are mighty unreasonable;
how the devil can you get any thing out of an empty
vessel, which I am at this blessed"&mdash;nuzzle&mdash;nuzzle&mdash;nuzzle.
Here, in his zeal to stow his cargo, he became
quite unintelligible, and I again asked the
midshipman to enlighten us.
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir," said he, "I know nothing regarding
it, saving what Monsieur Listado <i>told</i> me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, tell what I told you, then; that's a good
fellow"&mdash;mumble, mumble, munch, munch, quoth
our amigo.
</p>

<p>
"Brail, some of that ham;&mdash;go on, De Walden,
will ye&mdash;devil take the fellow;&mdash;bread, if you please,
Monsieur Duquesné&mdash;thank you.  How deucedly
hungry I am, to be sure;&mdash;that claret, Brail&mdash;and
the <i>monkey</i> of cool water&mdash;thank you&mdash;work along,
Henry."
</p>

<p>
The handsome boy laughed.  "Really, Mr Brail,
I don't know that any thing I have heard can interest
you&mdash;Monsieur Listado there has been frequently at
the prison confabulating with the hangman."
</p>

<p>
"Bah, you be hanged yourself, Henry," shouted
our uproarious friend, with his mouth full of bread
and butter.
</p>

<p>
"Well, he is the jailer at the genteelest, then&mdash;and
he, it seems, told him first of all that Adderfang
had been unexpectedly better&mdash;then, that he grew
worse&mdash;then better again, until yesterday, when he
told our accomplished friend"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Henry, do you value your life, you villain?" said
Listado, threatening him with his knife in one hand,
and the bread in another, as if he would have cast it
at his head, but still munching away.
</p>

<p>
"To be sure I do, Listado, so let me get on.  As I
was saying, when he called yesterday&mdash;lo! the prison
had been broken into some weeks ago, and the villain
stolen&mdash;that's all."
</p>

<p>
"All!" echoed I; "so you were really right as
to the man we saw being Adderfang."
</p>

<p>
"I never had a doubt of it in my own mind," said
the midshipman.
</p>

<p>
"Why," I continued, "there must have been connivance."
</p>

<p>
M. Duquesné smiled.  "Ah, Monsieur Brail, de
road&mdash;way you call, of dis country, and de habitants,
you not know&mdash;I make no vonder not large at all&mdash;it
has happen very customary."
</p>

<p>
"And so it has," said Mr Hudson; "the truth is,
Mr Brail, that here in Havanna few people are
inimical to the trade Adderfang was engaged in; on the
contrary, it is all but openly encouraged; nor have
they any great horror even to a piratical cruise now
and then, <i>if</i> successful; and where could they get
such a determined fellow for a leader as this same
Adderfang, who, I learn, was bred a sailor in early
life, although for some years after his father's death
he remained at home and studied for the bar? at least
so said your man Lennox."
</p>

<p>
"What a splendid specimen of the powers of the
garrote we have lost!" quoth Monsieur Listado,
still busied in making a most substantial meal;&mdash;"a
small cup of that excellent coffee, Miss Helen&mdash;bless
your lovely fingers&mdash;But, my dear boy, flown the
villain is," continued the Irishman, addressing me,
"however it came about; and before long he will be on the
high seas once more, I make no manner of doubt;
whether as slaver or pirate, heaven knows.  Of course,
your friends the Midges, Master Brail, will rejoice at
this, as I would at the escape of a snared fox, which
might afford sport another day; but, for one, I should
be deucedly loath to fall into his hands, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"And I agree with you for once, Listado, for no
joy in the world have I, that a scoundrel, who obliged
me with six inches of steel under my ribs, should escape."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Miss Sophie," said he, without noticing
the interruption, "have you ever seen him, this
Adderfang?  Fine man&mdash;square shoulders&mdash;small
waist&mdash;a piece of that yam, Mrs Hudson&mdash;thank
you&mdash;but a regular Don Juan&mdash;a devil among the
ladies&mdash;and&mdash;oh, Lord, I declare a bone has stuck in my
throat."
</p>

<p>
On that day week, the frigate arrived.  I was
very curious to see how the commodore would
meet De Walden; but it seems the latter had
written him to Jamaica, and there was no scene,
although I could perceive the kind old man's eye
sparkle, and a tear of joy trickle down his furrowed
cheek, whenever he could steal what he thought an
unobserved glance at him.  However, it was not my
province to pry into his secret, if secret there was.
</p>

<p>
The commodore now determined to sell the Midge
all standing, and to draft her crew to Gazelle once
more&mdash;and it was accordingly done.
</p>

<p>
As old Dogvane came over the side, after
having given up charge of her to the Spanish sailors
that came to take possession, he grumbled
out&mdash;"That same wicked little Midge an't done with her
buzzing or stinging either, or I mistake.  She has
fallen among thieves, or little better, that's sartain,
judging from the sample we have here,"&mdash;eyeing the
strangers,&mdash;"and I'll lay a pound of baccy, she will
either be put in the contraband slaving on the coast
of Africay again, or to some worse purpose, among
them keys and crooked channels hereaways.  I say, my
hearties," turning to the Spaniards, "what are your
masters agoing to do with this here fellucre?"
</p>

<p>
"To rone between Jamaica and dis wid
goods&mdash;passengers&mdash;one trader to be."
</p>

<p>
"One trader&mdash;no honest one, I'll venture&mdash;but
all's one to old Dogvane."
</p>

<p>
Next morning, De Walden came to my room as I
was dressing, with a packet from Jamaica, that had
been sent to Batabano, and thence across the island
to Havanna.  I opened it, and had to read it twice
over before I could comprehend the contents, or
ascertain what the writer wanted to be at.
</p>

<p>
To understand this letter sufficiently, be it known
that the author thereof was suffering at the time from
gout in his hand, and in consequence had to employ
a brown clerk as an amanuensis&mdash;a simple creature,
as I afterwards found, when I came to know him,
whose only qualification for his post was the writing,
like all his cast, a most beautiful hand; but,
unfortunately, in his blind zeal, he had given a little more
than had been intended to stand as the text by the
party whose signature was appended to it; in fact, he
had written down, <i>verbatim et literatim, all</i> that his
master <i>had said</i> while dictating the letter; and the
effect of the patchwork was infinitely ridiculous.  The
reason why the superfluous dialogue in it had not
been expunged was the want of time, and loss of the
spectacles, as stated.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Ballywindle Estate, Jamaica,</i><br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  "<i>Such a date.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
"MY DEAR NEPHEW,&mdash;I had letters from England,
although none from you&mdash;you boy of slender
manners.  Knowing how much I made of you when
you were a little potato button, I expected other
things;&mdash;but to the letters&mdash;they told me&mdash;the
devil fly away with this infernal gout, that makes me
employ a brown chap, who, they say, is somewhat
like me about the snout, as an amanuensis&mdash;mind
you spell that word now&mdash;and fortunately for you I
do so employ him, as he writes as beautiful a fist as
one would like to see in a long winter's morning
when the fog is thick&mdash;but, as I was saying, I had
letters telling me that you had gone out with your
kit packed in a ready-made coffin, to the coast of
Africa, with my excellent old friend Sir Oliver
Oakplank; who, as a recompense for a life spent in the
service, had been sent to die in the bight of Benin&mdash;that's
a parenthesis, mind&mdash;to gather negroes from
others who stole them&mdash;and that, according to
practice, the Gazelle, that is the name of the commodore's
ship, although it is probable you already know
as much, having been by this time three months on
board of her from all accounts&mdash;put that in a
parenthesis also&mdash;was to make the round voyage by
Jamaica to Havanna, and home.  Judge, then, my great
surprise when, after trudging to Kingston, I found
that you were not there in the old frigate at all, but
had chosen to go to Havanna in the tender; and
what was worse, I was at the same time told by your
uncle's correspondents, my excellent friends Peaweep,
Snipe, and Flamingo (what a broth of a boy that
same young Flamingo is!) that you were to be taken
into the Liverpool House, and to return direct from
Havanna, without visiting me at all, at all.
</p>

<p>
"Now, if that old villain, Peter Brail, your excellent
uncle, and all the rest of it, has had the heart to
do this, may the devil burn me if he shall ever get
another tierce of coffee from Lathom Frenche.  He
has plenty of young friends to bring on, while I have
none but you, Benjie; so he <i>must</i> give you up, or I
shall murder him.  But stop till I tell my story
properly.
</p>

<p>
"So, you see, after I heard of this change I was in
such a taking, that, to drown my disappointment, I had
a wet week with Sir Oliver and some Kingston friends;
for it was the rainy season, you must know, and devils
are those same Kingstonians, in the way of gentleman-like
libations of tepid Madeira and cold claret, whereby
I got another touch of my old remembrancer the gout,
under which I am at this blessed moment suffering
severely&mdash;I say, boy, bring me a rummer of Madeira
sangaree, and a hot yam with the brown, crisp and
well scraped, do you hear&mdash;well I declare the skin of
it is as beautiful as a berry, and the mealy inside as
fragrant as the dryest potato from Ballywindle in old
Ireland&mdash;so here's the 'glorious and immortal
memory,' and confound the Pope; but never mind, although,
you may just confound the gout too, when you are at
it.&mdash;But, as I was saying, I came home with the
gout brewing all the way, and got so wet one day,
that I dreaded lest, it should be driven into that
fortress, or rather that citadel, the stomach&mdash;there's a
poetical image for you&mdash;so I took a warming, that is,
I made another comfortable week of it on my return
home, just to keep up the circulation, and to drive
the enemy&mdash;don't be surprised at the militariness of
my lingo, for I am colonel of the regiment of foot
militia here&mdash;another parenthesis, Timothy&mdash;from,
the interior, and compel him to develope his strength
in the outworks, or rather to retreat to them, which
he, the gout, viz.  has done with a vengeance, let me
tell you; having clapperclawed what you would call
my larboard peg, and my starboard fin, zig-zagging
in his approaches, as regularly as Vauban or
Cohorn&mdash;fair play, you know&mdash;a sound limb on each side,
which is a mercy of its kind; so I hop from table
to bed, and <i>vice versa</i>, and balance myself the whole
way like a rope-dancer; for I hate a crutch&mdash;what
are you stopping for, Timothy&mdash;oh, I see, to mend
your pen&mdash;sangaree, Tim&mdash;bless me, how thirsty I
am, to be sure!&mdash;I hate a crutch, and my servants,
curiously enough, for we don't often agree, are
unanimous with me in that same, as somehow I break one
a-day, when I am driven to it, over their woolly
skulls: and that costs money&mdash;if you could pick up a
cheap lot of lancewood spars, now, in Havanna, that
would stand a blow&mdash;you might fetch me a hundred
or so&mdash;it is tough, and bends, and doesn't break like
mahogany or cedar.
</p>

<p>
"During my confinement, old Jacob Munroe, the
storekeeper at Montego bay, called to see me, and
get his account settled.  He brought a handsome
clergyman-looking man with him, dressed in black&mdash;ah,
you may leave that out&mdash;he will guess as much,
if I tell him he was a clerical-looking person&mdash;whom
he introduced to me as <i>Mister</i> Lennox, and
who had arrived in one of the Cuba smugglers some
days before.  Judge my surprise when this young
gentleman told me, with all the appearance of truth,
that he had been a corporal of marines on board the
Gazelle, although old Jacob called him at first an
<i>officer</i> of marines, forgetting to say whether <i>commissioned</i>
or not, and had actually been with you in the Midge&mdash;how
could you trust yourself in such a mussel-shell?&mdash;until
he had, through the interest of his
friends at home, obtained his discharge.
</p>

<p>
"He told me the whole story of your being wounded,
and taken into a Frenchman's house, and being
desperately in love with some young American
lady&mdash;but you know, Benjie, I don't like Americans&mdash;a
Yankee girl, forsooth!&mdash;put the Yankee girl in a
parenthesis&mdash;and a variety of other entertaining
anecdotes, which made my heart yearn towards the only
son of my dear sister Jane, although you have had
the misfortune to have a Scotchman to your father&mdash;but,
poor boy, he can't help that; so, Timothy, out
with all about the Scotchman&mdash;he was born in
Ireland, anyhow&mdash;for I am getting old now, Benjamin;
and although rich enough, I begin to feel desolate
and lonely, being without chick or child to comfort
me, excepting some yellowhammers&mdash;no, not you,
Timothy&mdash;so write away, my good lad&mdash;that claim a
sort of left-handed interest in me here.  But I have
been kind to them, and no doubt must answer for the
sins of my youth; but they are not just the sort of
representatives one would wish to leave behind them;
although, indeed, if this blessed state of things goes
on at the pace it is doing at home, we may see a
woolly-headed Lord Chancellor shortly&mdash;I hope he
will have a civil tongue in his head&mdash;and a flat-nosed
dingy-skinned Speaker of the honourable House.
</p>

<p>
"However, so far as I see, that will be a while
yet; and, in the mean time, I want you to give up
old Peter, if you can do so honourably, and pin your
faith on me.  But as I am a reasonable man, and may
not like you after all, when I do see you, I think it but
fair to send you the enclosed notarial copy of a bond
in your favour for L.10,000 sterling as a sort of
compensation for the measure I recommend, <i>if you take it</i>;
but which expresses in the body of it, as you see, that
it is only to become onerous on me, when you arrive
in my house here, after having made your election, as
aforesaid.  Now, Benjie, dear, if you are conscious that
you are a gentlemanlike, pleasant, honourable young
fellow, who can ride a bit, and shoot, and drink a bottle
of claret now and then&mdash;alas! there are no foxhounds
here&mdash;foxhounds in a parenthesis again, Tim&mdash;come
to me and change your ploughshare into a pruning-hook&mdash;no,
that's not it&mdash;your ploughshare into a billhook&mdash;no,
and that's not it neither&mdash;your bill-hook into
a pruning-hook&mdash;bah! botheration!&mdash;if you are all
that I ask you, and what my nephew <i>ought to be</i> by
descent, and be d&mdash;&mdash;d to him&mdash;if, in one word, <i>you
are a gentleman</i>&mdash;come to me, man&mdash;come and
comfort the poor, desolate, old fellow, who is pining in
his helpless days for the want of something to love;
and who, since he made up his mind to write for you,
is every moment grappling you to his Irish heart, in
joyous anticipation, with hooks of steel.  Write me
immediately, and follow yourself as soon as you can&mdash;or
you may follow yourself first, if equally convenient,
and let your letter come after&mdash;and enclosed
you have also a draft on Mr M&mdash;&mdash; for 1000 dollars
as earnest, and to clear you at Havanna.
</p>

<p>
"Regards to Sir Oliver, who will by this time&mdash;no,
write that time&mdash;<i>that</i> is, by the time when he
will get this&mdash;be with you, and to young Donovan&mdash;a
prime boy that same Donovan would make, with a
little training, as ever carried a shamrock in his
hat-band, or a shillelah in his fist&mdash;and old Sprawl, I love
the rum-looking, warm-hearted creature, because he

"P.S.&mdash;The post is just going off to Montego
bay, so I have no time to have this corrected; nor,
indeed, could I read it over if I had, as I have mislaid
my spectacles&mdash;so excuse blunders."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
Here was a new vista opening up with a vengeance&mdash;so,
after having read over the letter repeatedly, I
determined to submit it at once to Mr Hudson, whom
I knew to be a clear-headed man, notwithstanding his
guessings and calculations, and friendly withal.  He
thought the advice given sound.
</p>

<p>
"And as a proof of it," said he, "if my son were
in your position, and had such an offer made to him,
I would not hesitate a moment in recommending him
to accept it.  Indeed, you are in a great measure
in duty bound to obey a kinsman, who, by your own
account, has been so kind to you; and who can be
of such essential service to you, especially when he
counsels you so reasonably."
</p>

<p>
I will not conceal that many a fond hope fluttered
about my heart, as I reflected what this new state of
things might bring about; and that very morning I
struck while the iron was hot, and, like a very wise
person, took Miss Helen Hudson, of all people on
earth, to my councils, and asked <i>her</i> advice, forsooth.
</p>

<p>
"Helen, what would <i>you advise</i> me to do?"
</p>

<p>
"Benjamin, I cannot <i>advise</i>&mdash;I am a simple girl&mdash;but
whatever you may do, or wherever you may be&mdash;heaven
knows"&mdash;her voice faltered&mdash;"heaven
knows your happiness will always be," &amp;c. &amp;c. &amp;c.  So
she burst into tears, and I caught her in my arms,
and&mdash;oh Lord, what a devil of a bother this same love is!
</p>

<p>
"Now, Helen," said I, "let us compose ourselves&mdash;I
am as yet in a manner unknown to you; but to
convince you that I am an honourable man, all that I
ask is, that you shall hold this engagement sacred,
until I can communicate with my uncle.  If I find
my prospects as satisfactory as I expect, I will
immediately return, and throw myself at your feet; if I do
not, I do not say that I will not still prefer my suit;
<i>but you shall not be bound by your promise</i>.  So
my Helen, now."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said the darling girl, as she rose, smiling
through her tears like&mdash;oh, all ye gods, for a
simile! but never mind&mdash;from the sofa where we had been
sitting&mdash;"yes; <i>your</i> Helen now, Benjamin."
</p>

<p>
"Heyday," quoth Mrs Hudson, as she entered the
room; "here's a scene.  Why, Helen, you have
been weeping, I see&mdash;and Mr Brail!&mdash;Now what is
wrong?  Tell me, dearest?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, not now, mother&mdash;not now.  Come with
me&mdash;come, and I will tell you all."
</p>

<p>
And as they passed towards the door, who should
stumble in upon us but Monsieur Listado.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning, Mrs Hudson&mdash;good-morning.
Halloo&mdash;and is it off they are, without so much as a
bow, or&mdash;Brail, what is the meaning of all this?&mdash;Miss
Hudson is weeping, as I am a gentleman.  You
cannot have been uncivil to her&mdash;it is impossible.
But, Benjamin Brail, much as I esteem you, if I
thought"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Out of my way, you troublesome blockhead,"
said I, in the hurry and confusion of the moment;
and I brushed past him and fled to my own room,
with the most comical mixture of feelings possible.
It was full half an hour before I could control them,
and recover my composure; and I had just begun to
subside into my everyday character, when I received
a message from Mr Hudson, to whom his wife had
communicated all that had passed between his daughter
and me.  I never can forget the anxiety I felt to
construe the expression of his face, when I first
entered the room.  It was favourable, heaven be
thanked.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Brail, I know what has passed between you
and Helen,"&mdash;oh Lord, thought I&mdash;"I would have
been better pleased, had you explained yourself either
to Mrs Hudson or me, before matters had gone so
far; but this cannot be helped now."&mdash;He paused
a good while.  "From what I know of you, Mr
Brail, I have more confidence in you, I rejoice to
say, than I ever had before in any young man I have
known for so short a period."  I bowed.  "And
your very prudent proposals to my daughter argue
you possessed of sound discretion."  Beyond my
hopes, thought I.  "So I calculate you had better let
me see that same letter of your uncle's again that
I read before; and we will also take a look at the bond."
</p>

<p>
Here shone out the Yankee; but he was using no
more than common circumspection, in a matter involving
his daughter's happiness so largely.  Both were
submitted to him, and on the morrow we were to
hold a grand palaver on the subject.  He had left
me, and I had just dressed for dinner, when a gentle
tap was heard, and an officer of the American frigate
presented himself with a grave face at the door.
</p>

<p>
"Beg pardon, Mr Brail; I am sorry our friend
Listado should have pressed me into the service in
this matter; but I pray you to believe that I shall be
most happy, if I can be instrumental in making up
the quarrel, without resorting to extreme measures."
</p>

<p>
"Here's a coil," thought I.  "Mr Listado! a
quarrel!  I have no quarrel with Mr Listado that
I am aware of."
</p>

<p>
"My dear sir, I am afraid he thinks otherwise.
Here is his letter," said the American, handing it to me.
</p>

<p>
"Let me see," I opened it.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"SIR&mdash;I am as little given to take unnecessary
offence as any man; but as I have good reason to
believe, from what I saw, that you have affronted
Miss Hudson; and as I am <i>quite</i> certain you have
slighted me, I request you will either apologize
to her and myself"&mdash;(her and myself, indeed,
interjected I)&mdash;"or give me a meeting to-morrow
morning, at any hour most convenient for you, that
does not interfere with breakfast.&mdash;I remain, your
humble servant,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"LAURENCE LISTADO."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Now, Mr Crawford," said I, "this is a mighty
ridiculous affair altogether.  I am not aware, as I
said before, of having given Listado any offence;
and what he can mean by attempting to fasten this
very unnecessary quarrel on me, I cannot for the life
of me divine."
</p>

<p>
"So far as his own injuries are concerned," said
Crawford, "I am authorized to say, that he perceived
you were confused at the time, and did not well
know, apparently, what you were about; so he makes
no account of your conduct to himself; but the
affront to Miss Hudson "&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here William Hudson entered with a knowing
face; and on being informed what had happened, he
burst into a long fit of laughter.  Crawford looked
aghast, and was beginning to get angry, just as
Hudson found his tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Crawford, back out of this absurd affair
altogether; why, surely <i>I</i> am the man to take up my
sister's quarrel, if quarrel there must be."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be d&mdash;&mdash;d if you or any man shall take up
her quarrel, now since I have made it mine," quoth
Listado, swinging suddenly into the room.
</p>

<p>
"What brings <i>you</i> here, in the name of all that is
absurd?" said Hudson.
</p>

<p>
"Why, William, I was thinking that the loud
laughing possibly portended some fresh insult; at
any rate, from the time Crawford was taking to fix
matters, I began to fear that the quarrel might miss
fire after all."
</p>

<p>
"Be quiet now, Listado," said Hudson, still scarcely
able to speak; "who ever saw a matter of this
kind managed by the principals.  I am Brail's second;
leave me to deal with Crawford."
</p>

<p>
"Well, Brail," quoth Listado, addressing <i>me direct</i>,
to my great surprise, "let you and I sit down here,
until our friends there fix when and where we may
shoot each other comfortably;" and he hauled me
away by the button-hole as familiarly as ever.
</p>

<p>
The two lieutenants walked to the other end of the
room, where Crawford's face soon became "as joyous
as Hudson's had been; and both of them had to turn
their backs on us, and apply their handkerchiefs to
their mouths to conceal their laughter.  At length
they mustered sufficient command of feature to turn
towards us, and approach; but every now and then
there was a sudden involuntary jerk of Hudson's
shoulders, and a lifting of his eyebrows, and a
compression of his lips, that showed how difficult it was
for him to refrain from a regular explosion.
</p>

<p>
"If I understand you rightly," began Crawford,
slowly and sedately addressing his principal, "you do
not press for an apology on account of any slight to
yourself in this matter, whether intentional or not on
the part of Mr Brail?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly not&mdash;by no manner of means&mdash;I have
a great regard for him, and I am convinced he intended
none.  I perceived he had been pushed off his
balance, some how or other, and I can allow for it."
</p>

<p>
"Spoken like a reasonable being, and a right good
fellow.  Then, as I take it," continued the American
lieutenant, "the whole quarrel depends on this: Mr
Brail has, <i>according to your belief, affronted Miss
Hudson</i>; he must therefore either apologize for what
he said or did to her, or turn out with you?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you know, Crawford," said our friend, rubbing
his hands, "you are a devilish clever fellow;
you have hit it to a nicety, upon my honour."
</p>

<p>
"Well, now," quoth Crawford, turning to me,
"will you, Mr Brail, to save further bother, make
this apology to Mr Listado?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said I, deliberately, and with a strong emphasis.
</p>

<p>
"That's right, Benjie," quoth Listado, fidgetting
with delight, as if the certainty of the quarrel
was now put beyond all doubt.  "Didn't I tell you
that he would make no apology?  Now, mind you,
don't interfere with the breakfast hour to-morrow,
Crawford, as I am invited to come here."
</p>

<p>
Hudson could stand it no longer.&mdash;"I'll tell you
what, my dear Listado, I have my sister's, Miss Helen
Hudson's, commands, that nothing more be done in
this matter; and farther, that so far from Mr Brail
having affronted her, he really paid her the most
profound compliment that a gentleman can pay to a lady."
</p>

<p>
"As how, so please you?" quoth Listado, with a
most vinegar grin, although deucedly puzzled at the
same time; "a lady don't weep at a compliment
usually."
</p>

<p>
"In plain English, then, Laurence, Mr Brail had
just, as you entered, asked my sister to&mdash;<i>to marry him</i>."
</p>

<p>
Listado's face altered&mdash;his jaw fell&mdash;"<i>Marry him</i>!
I thought so; why, this is worse and worse.  Now, I
will pink him, by Jupiter!  Marry <i>him</i>, indeed!
While Laurence Listado lives she shall be <i>compelled</i>
to do no such thing.  I am a man of some fortune,
and, as you all know, I am desperately in love with
her myself; so fix time and place, and damn the hour
of breakfast now entirely.  I will shoot him&mdash;any
time&mdash;now&mdash;across that table.  Oh Brail! you
incomparable hyp"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hush! hush!" said Hudson, clapping his hand
on Listado's mouth; "hush! he has not only had
the insolence to ask her to marry him&mdash;[here Listado
clenched his hand, bit his lip, and gave three or four
tremendous strides to the other end of the room]&mdash;not
only has he asked her to marry him, but&mdash;<i>but he
has been accepted</i>!"
</p>

<p>
Poor Laurence faced right round.  "Say so again,
and&mdash;&mdash;Poo, Hudson, you are jesting with me; but
here comes Mrs Hudson.  Madam, has Mr Brail had
the audacity to ask your daughter in marriage?  And
has she had the egregious folly to accept him in
preference to your servant, and her humble admirer,
Laurence Listado?"
</p>

<p>
Mrs Hudson looked at me, and then at her son,
and then at me again&mdash;as much as to say&mdash;"very
indelicate conduct this, on <i>your part</i>, at any
rate"&mdash;at length, "Mr Brail, I am thunderstruck&mdash;how came
my daughter to have been made the subject of a
brawl?&mdash;was this"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"My dear mother," chimed in her son&mdash;"it is all
a mistake&mdash;Brail is not to blame, and no more is
Listado&mdash;say, has Helen Hudson accepted Brail, or has
she not?"
</p>

<p>
"She certainly has accepted him&mdash;<i>on conditions</i>."
</p>

<p>
Listado's eyes, during this colloquy, were riveted
on Mrs Hudson's face.  When she uttered these
words, he slowly turned them on me, and while the
tears hopped over his cheek, he advanced, and took
my hand.
</p>

<p>
"Brail, I wish you joy&mdash;from my soul, I do&mdash;even
although I&mdash;curse it, never mind&mdash;but, man, could
you not take Sophie Duquesné?&mdash;yet&mdash;even at the
eleventh hour, Benjamin?&mdash;it would mightily oblige
me, do you know."
</p>

<p>
I smiled.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, I have been a fool; and I have ill-used
you, Brail, but I am sorry for it&mdash;so, God bless
you, my dear boy&mdash;you are a fortunate fellow"&mdash;and
thereupon, he ran out of the room, without saying
good-by to any one.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, I had a visit from him, before I got
out of my bed.  He came into my room with a most
ludicrous, serio-comic expression of countenance, and
drawing a long sigh, sat down on a chair by my
bedside without uttering a word.
</p>

<p>
As I had not forgotten his strange conduct the day
before, I thought I would let him have his own way,
and leave him to break ground first.  He sat still
about a minute longer, and then clasping his hands
together, with his Barcelona most pathetically
sticking out between his fingers&mdash;he turned round, and
looked at me with his great prominent goggle eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Do I look as if I had been weeping, Benjamin&mdash;are
my eyes bloodshot?"
</p>

<p>
"They are certainly inflamed," said I, rather shortly.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," said he, in a small, dolorous whine&mdash;"I
knew it, Benjie&mdash;my heart is as soft this morning as
a waxy potato.  I was a great big fool last evening,
Brail, and I don't think I am much wiser to-day, and
all for a little, hook-nosed, dumpy woman.  Do you
know, I took the affair so deeply to heart, that I went
home, and drank three bottles of claret <i>solus</i>, and
afterwards topped off with hot brandy grog?"&mdash;(a
very sufficing reason for your bloodshot eyes, thought
I),&mdash;"and I believe I will go hang myself."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo&mdash;hang cats and blind puppies, man,"
said I.  "Come, come, now, Listado&mdash;you are not
here to renew our quarrel, or rather <i>your</i> quarrel, for
I declare I have none with you&mdash;but why bring Miss
Hudson on the carpet again?  She did not deceive
you, Listado&mdash;you know she never gave you any
encouragement."
</p>

<p>
"<i>She did not deceive me</i>, certainly; but did she
not persave that I admired her; <i>so why did she allow
me to deceive myself</i>?"
</p>

<p>
I laughed outright&mdash;"Come, man, you are expecting
too much at the hands of a young lady, who of
course is accustomed to admiration.  She was not
aware you entertained any very tender regard for her;
why, it was only three days ago at breakfast that you
broke off in the middle of a beautiful compliment to
her eyebrow&mdash;the worst feature in her face, by the
way&mdash;to ask for a plate of broiled ham and eggs.  You
may rest assured, my dear Listado, that Miss Hudson
never dreamed you were in love with her&mdash;and, in
sober earnest, are you so, now?&mdash;come, out with it."
</p>

<p>
He looked at me, with the strangest twinkle of his
eye, then slewing his head from side to side, he twitched
up one corner of his mouth, as he said&mdash;"Will you,
or will you not, take Sophie Duquesné, Brail?&mdash;Lord,
man, she is the finer woman of the two, and surely
you have known neither of the girls long enough to
have any peculiar preference."
</p>

<p>
The idea of my <i>swopping</i> my betrothed wife, as one
would do a horse, merely, forsooth, to oblige him, was
exceedingly entertaining.
</p>

<p>
"Really, Listado, you are a most curious animal&mdash;I
have told you No&mdash;and I reiterate, No."
</p>

<p>
"Well then, Brail, may the devil fly away with you
and your dearie both, for, since you must know, I was
not in love after all&mdash;I am sure I was not, although I
confess being at one time very near it&mdash;so all
happiness to you, my darling.  Do you know, Benjie, that
I have been quizzing you all this while?"
</p>

<p>
I did not know it, nor did I believe it, but, by way
of letting him down gently, I said nothing; and that
very day, I took an affectionate leave of my excellent
old friend Sir Oliver, who was that day to drop down
under the Moro, preparatory to sailing; of my worthy
cousin Dick Lanyard, Mr Sprawl, and the other
Gazelles and Midges, who had been kind to me; and next
morning I secured my passage in a Kingston trader,
that was to sail for Jamaica that day week.

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
</h3>

<h4>
THE MOSQUITO.
</h4>

<p>
The short interval between the period when I
resolved upon this step, and of putting it into
execution, was passed in a state of mind little
enviable&mdash;in a strange mixture of pleasure and pain, of
joy and grief.  At one moment both Helen and
myself were buoyed up with the most joyous
anticipations; at another a weight hung on our hearts,
that we could not ourselves account for.  With us,
however, the chances of happiness seemed to
preponderate; but it was far otherwise with poor De
Walden and Sophie Duquesné, who, children as they
both were, had also tumbled head over heels in love,
before they were aware of it.
</p>

<p>
For several days the young midshipman had been
kept on board attending to his duty; it was the last
evening but one that I was to spend at Havanna,
when, against Mrs Hudson's wish, and, I need not
say, most diametrically opposed to Helen's and mine,
old Mr Duquesné had invited some friends in the
evening; and, having dined at the usual hour, the
girls were having their hair dressed in the boudoir
already described, while we, the male part of the
family, were enjoying our wine in the room that had
been my bedroom.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr Duquesné," said I, "I really am quite
ashamed at the trouble I must have put you all to
lately; why" (looking round me) "I seem to have
actually dispossessed you of your dining saloon for
some time.  I was not aware of this before."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, it does not signify none at all, my dear
sare&mdash;de happiness and obligation were all mine.  I
cannot wish you were wound again&mdash;oh <i>certainement</i>,
I could not do dat sing; <i>mais</i> I happy would
be, you should sprain your foot, elbow, or head, or
any leetle fingare&mdash;so as you were to stay here some
time less&mdash;more I mean&mdash;<i>assurément</i> you cannot
maintain your resolution to leave us yesterday?&mdash;put
off your depart until last week."
</p>

<p>
"Impossible, my very kind friend; I have too long
trespassed on your kindness&mdash;kindness which I am
sure I shall never be able to repay."&mdash;Here we were
interrupted by De Walden entering the room.&mdash;"Ah,
Henry, how are you?"
</p>

<p>
Our excellent host and Mrs Hudson both rose to
receive him.  He looked very pale, and had a
nervous unsettledness about him, that contrasted
unpleasantly with the recollection of his usual quiet and
naturally graceful manner.
</p>

<p>
After returning their civility, he drew his chair to
the table, and I noticed he helped himself very
hastily to a large bumper of Madeira, part of which was
spilt from the trembling of his hand, as he carried the
glass to his lips.  "Gentlemen," at this juncture said
Helen, from the other room, "had you not better
come closer to the balcony here, and give us the
benefit of your conversation, now since Master De
Walden graces your board?"  Here Sophie, who
was under the hands of our old friend Pepe Biada,
slapped Helen, as if there had been some bantering
going on between them, having reference to the
young fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Certainly," said William Hudson; "but come,
Brail, would it not be an improvement on Helen's
plan, were we to adjourn to the other room
altogether&mdash;this one"&mdash;continued he, looking towards
Mr Duquesné&mdash;"will be wanted soon&mdash;indeed, Nariz
de Niéve and Manuel have once or twice popped
in their beautiful countenances at the door as hints
for us to move."
</p>

<p>
We all with one accord rose at this&mdash;the two
elderly gentlemen adjourned to the counting-house,
while young Hudson, De Walden, and your humble
servant, repaired to the sanctum of the young ladies.
When we entered we found Mrs Hudson sitting,
already dressed for company, at one side of the piano,
where Helen was practising some new air, with (oh,
shocking to an English eye) her hair <i>en papillote</i>,
while the beautiful long jet black tresses of her
charming companion were still under the hands of
the little monkified barber, my old ally, Pepe Biada.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Brail," said Mrs Hudson, "I thought you
did not patronise this foreign free-and-easy fashion
that has crept in amongst us&mdash;Helen, there, said she
was sure you would not come."
</p>

<p>
I laughed&mdash;"Why, Helen is wrong for once, you
see, my dear madam; but if I had any objection, any
slight scruple, you must allow I have very easily
surmounted it at any rate; and as for De Walden there,
he seems to have none at all."
</p>

<p>
He turned as I spoke, and both he and Sophie, who
had been communing together in an under tone,
started and blushed, as if somewhat <i>caught</i>, to use
a vulgar but expressive phrase, and I saw a tear stand
in the dark beauty's eye.  But De Walden seemed
by this time to have got his feelings under control,
although, from the altered manner of poor Sophie, it
was not to be concealed from me, that some communication
had just been made to her by him, that lay
heavy on her young heart.
</p>

<p>
It now became necessary that we should retire to
dress; and by the time I returned, the company had
begun to assemble; but De Walden was nowhere to
be seen&mdash;he had returned to his ship, it appeared;
and although poor Sophie did the honours during the
early part of the evening with her usual elegance, yet
her customary sprightliness was altogether gone, and
it was evident how much it cost her to control her
feelings.  About midnight, however&mdash;worn out,
heart-crushed, and dejected, she could no longer sustain this
assumed unconcern, and retired on the plea of a
headach.  But the rest of us, hard-hearted animals as we
were, having got into the spirit of the thing, at the
expense of some mental exertion, and not a little
champagne, contrived to forget poor Sophie and De
Walden for a time, and so carried on until daydawn.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" said I to William Hudson.
</p>

<p>
"A gun from Gazelle, on weighing, I guess," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," I rejoined&mdash;"I did not know she was to
sail before Sunday."
</p>

<p>
"It stood for Sunday, I believe&mdash;at least so De
Walden told me, until yesterday afternoon, when all
the merchantmen having reported ready for sea, the
commodore determined to be off."
</p>

<p>
"The sound of that cannon," said Helen Hudson
to me, with an agitated voice, as we sat together,
"will be like a knell to one we know of, Benjamin."
</p>

<p>
A short time after this the party broke up, and we
retired to rest.  With me it was short and troubled,
and I awoke little refreshed about noon&mdash;the hour
we had previously arranged for breakfast.
</p>

<p>
I was to sail the following morning, and Mrs Hudson,
with matronly kindness and consideration, left
her daughter and me very much alone and together
that forenoon and evening.  After I had made my
little preparations for embarking, laid in my sea-stock,
and arranged for my passage in the British brig the
Ballahoo, I returned in the evening just as the night
was closing in.  I found Helen sitting alone in the
boudoir, and I could not but perceive that she had
been weeping.
</p>

<p>
"How now, dearest," said I, as gaily as the weight
at my own heart would let me&mdash;"How now, Helen&mdash;why
so sad&mdash;you know we have all along been
aware that we must part, but I trust only temporarily.
Come, now, you have had your wish gratified,
by Sir Oliver leaving Dicky Phantom with you, until
his friends in England have been consulted&mdash;and take
care, Helen&mdash;I shall grow jealous of the small rogue,
if you don't mind.  So, come now, Helen, don't be
foolish&mdash;We shall soon have a happy meeting, if it
pleases heaven, and"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I hope so&mdash;I trust so, Benjamin&mdash;but in such a
climate who can promise themselves a happy or a
certain meeting?  Have we not ourselves met friends
in the morning, who never saw the sun rise again?
Oh, Benjamin, my heart is fond and foolish."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, Helen, but cheer up, my sweet girl&mdash;our
prospects are fair compared to poor De Walden's."
</p>

<p>
"True, and so they are&mdash;poor Sophie, too&mdash;but
there has been no declaration on his part"&mdash;as if
willing to lead the conversation from our own
sorrows.&mdash;"He is the most open-hearted lad, Benjamin, I
ever met.  Early in the forenoon, yesterday, he told
Sophie, that except Sir Oliver Oakplank, he had not
one friend in the wide world who cared a straw about
him; what claim he had on him he did not say&mdash;that
he had nothing to look to, but getting on in the
service through his own exertions; and more than once
he has already told my mother, that if there had been
the smallest chance of joining his frigate in Jamaica,
he would instantly have left Havanna, had he even
worked his passage.  He said he feared it was neither
prudent nor honourable his remaining here.  Poor,
poor Henry."
</p>

<p>
"Did he say any thing of his early life?" said I,
my curiosity getting the better of my propriety of
feeling.
</p>

<p>
"Not much.  He had been, from his own account,
the Child of Misfortune.  The current of his life,
from the earliest period he could recollect, had been
dark and troubled.  Few gleams of sunshine had ever
brightened the stream; and when they did dance for
a moment on a passing joyous ripple that crisped
its surface, it was but to give place to heavy clouds,
under whose lowering shadow it again assumed its
usual leaden hue&mdash;And, oh, Benjamin, how is it to be
with ourselves?  You have also, from your own
account, suffered much, from loss of fortune, and of
near and dear friends.  May not our own acquaintance
prove one of those evanescent gleams in <i>our</i> lives?
If&mdash;if"&mdash;and she clasped her arms round my neck&mdash;"if
our meeting should prove but a sparkle on the
wave, Benjamin, after all, that twinkles for a moment
before it floats down the dark stream of our existence
to be no more seen&mdash;Oh, my love, if we are never to
meet again"&mdash;&mdash;And she wept until her heart was
like to burst.
</p>

<p>
"Hope for the best, my dearest Helen; hope for
the best.  I will soon return, Helen&mdash;I will, believe
me&mdash;so be composed&mdash;we must not give way to our
feelings&mdash;we have a duty to perform to ourselves, our
friends, and each other; nay, more, to that all-gracious
Being who has blessed us by bringing us together,
and who has smiled on our prospects thus far&mdash;and
here comes your mother, let us ask her blessing
for&mdash;for"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I broke off, for I durst not say out my say; but in
furtherance of my determination, after parting with
my friends for the night, and stealing a kiss from
little Dicky as he slept like a rose bud steeped in dew;
with the assistance of William Hudson, I got my
small kit away without suspicion, and repaired on
board the Ballahoo.
</p>

<p>
When I got on the deck of the brig it was quite
dark, and every thing was in great confusion,
preparatory to getting under weigh in the morning.  The
crew&mdash;blacks, browns, and whites, Englishmen and
Spaniards&mdash;were gabbling aloft and shouting below,
as some were bending sails, and others hoisting them
up to the yards; while others were tumbling about
bales of tobacco on deck, and lowering them down the
hatchway, where a number of hired negroes were
stowing the same away in the hold.  Her cargo
consisted of logwood, hides, and tobacco, the blending
of the effluvia from the two latter being any thing
but ambrosial.
</p>

<p>
When I went below I found at least a dozen Spanish
passengers busily employed in stowing away their
luggage in the cabin.  I could not help being greatly
struck with the careless way in which they chucked
their bags of doubloons about, as if they had been
small sacks of barley; and the recklessness they
displayed in exposing such heaps of glittering pieces of
apparently <i>untold gold</i>, to the eyes of the crew and
myself, for I was an utter stranger to all of them.
"Were I to exhibit a handful of bank-notes in
England in this way!" thought I.  The confidence these
traders appeared to place in their negro servants,
absolutely astonished me, so much greater was it than I
ever could have dreamed of; but the strangest part of
the affair was yet to come.  The English captain of the
brig, after having ordered the boats to be hoisted in,
had just come down; and seeing me seated on the
locker, leaning with my back against the rudder-case,
and silently observing, with folded arms, the
tumultuous conduct of the Dons, addressed me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"A new scene to you, Mr Brail, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
"It is so, certainly.  Are our friends there not
afraid that those black fellows who are bustling about
may take a fancy to some of these rouleaux of
doubloons, that they are packing away into their
portmanteaus, and trunks there?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," rejoined he, smiling; "most of these
poor fellows are household slaves, who have been, very
probably, born and bred up in their families; not a few
may even be their foster brothers, and all of that class
are perfectly trustworthy; in truth, sir, as an
Englishman, I am sorry to say it, but they treat their
domestic negroes infinitely better than we do.  As to
the field slaves, I cannot judge, but I can speak as to
the fact of the others from long experience.  A
Spanish family look on negroes of this class as part and
portion of the household; in fact, they are not bondsmen
at all, except in name; for they are better cared
for than servants, be they white or black, in any other
countries I know.  Indeed, now that I reflect, you
must have noticed, they don't even suffer the humiliation
of being called 'slave,'&mdash;'criado,' the common
name given them by their masters, signifying literally
servant.  The harsher, 'esclavo,' being seldom,
indeed never, applied to them, unless when they have
been guilty of some default."
</p>

<p>
"Heavens!" I here exclaimed, "what, are they
all going to bed, with your supper untouched on the
table?&mdash;see if they be not undressing!"
</p>

<p>
He laughed.  "You shall soon know the reason of
their stripping, sir," said he.  "It is contraband to
carry off either gold or silver coin here; and you shall
presently see an instance of Spanish ingenuity in
defrauding their revenue laws on the one hand, and of
the trust they place in their coloured servants on the
other; of their <i>own</i> dishonesty, and the implicit
confidence they place in the integrity of <i>others</i>, and
those others negro slaves."
</p>

<p>
The operation of <i>peeling</i> was all this while going
on amongst the gingham-coated gentry, who, when
naked to their trowsers, presented a most absurd
appearance, each of them having sewed round his waist
and loins, next his skin, from four to six double
bands of coarse linen or canvass, like so many
eel-skins, each filled with broad gold pieces, packed on
their edges, and overlapping each other, until they
were fairly pistol proof, in scale armour of gold.
</p>

<p>
After loud shouts of laughter at the manner in
which they had <i>done</i> the <i>piés de gallo</i>, or custom-house
officers, they stowed away the specie and donned
their clothes again, when lo! the black "criados,"
to my great astonishment, began to strip in
turn.  Presently Blackie was exhibited in the same
state of nudity as his master had recently been; and
the gold pieces were in like manner peeled off <i>him</i>.
</p>

<p>
These transactions taking place in a confined well-cabin,
lit by a small skylight, with the thermometer
standing at ninety-five, had no very great purifying
effect on the atmosphere&mdash;the blended steam of human
carcasses and tallow candles being any thing but
savoury.
</p>

<p>
The captain having very civilly given up his own
berth to me; after having satisfied my curiosity, I
retired to steal such rest as I might expect to snatch,
in so uncomfortable a fellowship; and was about
toppling over into a sound snooze, when my Spanish
allies, inspired by libations of bad brandy, with which
they had washed down their mess of garlic and jerked
beef, chose to chant in chorus, most vociferously, the
popular peninsular song of the day, "A la guerra, a la
guerra Españoles."  This was absurd enough from a
set of shopkeepers and smugglers; but being deucedly
tired, I soon grew accustomed to their noise, which
seemed to have no end, and fell fast asleep.
</p>

<p>
In the morning, the bustle overhead awoke me; and
having got up and dressed, I went on deck, where I
was glad to find that the confusion of the previous
night had very much subsided.
</p>

<p>
The vessel in which I had embarked was a long
low French-built brig, with very high solid bulwarks,
pierced for sixteen guns, but having only six
twelve-pound carronades mounted.
</p>

<p>
I was informed by the captain that she was a very
fast sailer, which I found to be true; indeed her share
of the trade between Kingston and Havanna very
much depended on this qualification.
</p>

<p>
Her hull was beautifully moulded; a superfine run,
beautiful bows, and sides as round as an apple.  By
the time I got on deck, the topsails and topgallant
sails were sheeted home and hoisted; the cable being
right up and down.  After several quick clattering
revolutions of the windlass, "We are a-weigh," sung
out the skipper, and presently all was bustle on board,
securing the anchor, during which the vessel began
to glide slowly along towards the harbour's mouth,
and under the enormous batteries that line it on either
side.
</p>

<p>
When we got to sea, the breeze failed us; and, as the
sun rose, we lay roasting on the smooth swell, floating
bodily away on the gulf-stream to the northward.
</p>

<p>
We were baffled in this way for three tedious days,
until I began to think we should never lose sight of
the Florida shore.  At length a breeze from the
eastward sprang up, that enabled us to stem the gulf-stream.
</p>

<p>
In the night of the fourth day, after leaving
Havanna, I had come on deck.  It was again nearly
calm, and the sails were beginning to flap against the
masts.  There was no moon, but the stars shone
brightly.  Several large fish were playing about, and
I was watching one of them, whose long sparkling
wake pointed out his position, when the master of
the brig, who had followed me, and now stood beside
me at the gangway, remarked, that there was an
uncommon appearance in the northwest quarter.
</p>

<p>
I looked, and fancied I saw a glare, as from a fire
on shore, but so faint that I could not be certain.  I
therefore resumed my walk on deck, along with the
captain.  The dew now began to fall in showers at
every shake of the wet sails.
</p>

<p>
"Why, we shall get soaked here, skipper, if the
breeze don't freshen?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, sir, I wish it would, with all my heart.  I
have no fancy for knocking about in this neighbourhood
one minute longer than I can help, I assure you.
There are some hookers cruising in the channel here,
that might prove unpleasant acquaintances if they
overhauled us.  I say, steward, hand me up my
night-glass&mdash;the glare on our starboard bow, down to
leeward there, increases, sir."
</p>

<p>
I looked, and saw he was right.  Some clouds had
risen in that direction over the land, which reflected
the light of a large fire beneath in bright red masses.
</p>

<p>
"Are you sure that fire is on the land?" said I,
after having taken a look at it through the nightglass.
</p>

<p>
"No.  I am not," said he; "on the contrary, I
have my suspicions it is at sea; however, we shall
soon ascertain, for here comes the breeze at last."
</p>

<p>
We bowled along for an hour, when it again fell
nearly calm; but we had approached so close as to be
able distinctly to make out that the light we had seen
did in very truth proceed from a vessel on fire.  It
was now near three o'clock in the morning, and I
proposed to the skipper to keep away towards the fire, in
order to lend any assistance in our power to the crew
of the burning vessel, if need were.
</p>

<p>
"No, no, sir&mdash;no fear of the crew, if the vessel
has taken fire accidentally, because they are well in
with the land, and they could even, with this light
air, run her ashore on the Florida reefs, or take to
their boats; but I fear the unfortunate craft has been
set fire to by one of those marauding villains I alluded
to.  However, be that as it may, I will stand on our
course until daylight at any rate, when we shall be able
to see about us.  In the mean time, keep a bright
look-out forward there&mdash;do you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir."
</p>

<p>
I was too much interested by this incident to think
of going below; so I remained on deck, as did the
master, until the day dawned.
</p>

<p>
As the approach of sunrise drew near, the bright
yellow flame faded into a glowing red.  Gradually the
crimson colour of the clouds overhead faded, and
vanished.  The morning lightened, the fire disappeared
altogether, and we could only make out a dense
column of smoke rising up slowly into the calm grey
morning sky.  The object on fire was now about four
miles on the starboard beam, as near as we could judge.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said I, "there is the breeze steady at
last," as it came down strong, with a hoarse rushing
noise, heard long before it reached us, and
roughening the blue water to windward, just as the sun
rose.  It was preceded by the pride of the morning,
a smart shower, which pelted on our decks, and the
next moment our light sails aloft filled&mdash;the topsail
sheets then felt the strain of the canvass under the
freshening blast.  The brig lay over&mdash;the green wave
curled outwards, roaring from the cutwater&mdash;the
strength of the breeze struck her&mdash;and away she flew
like a seabird before it.
</p>

<p>
"There it is&mdash;strong and steady to be sure," cried
the captain, rubbing his hands joyously; "and with
such a capful of wind I don't fear any thing here
smaller than a frigate; so haul out the boom
mainsail, and set the square one&mdash;run up the flying
jib&mdash;come, Mr Brail, we shall keep her away, and see
what is going on yonder, <i>now</i> since we have the
old barky under command."
</p>

<p>
We rapidly approached the burning vessel, which
was still becalmed, and lying motionless on the silver
swell, veiled from our sight by the pillar of cloud
that brooded over it, which continued to ascend
straight up into the clear heaven, the top of it
spreading and feathering out like the drooping leaves of
some noble palm; but the moment that the breeze
which we brought along with us struck the column,
it blew off like the tree I have likened it to, levelled
before the blast, and streamed away down to leeward
in a long whirling trail, disclosing to our view the
black hull and lower masts of a large vessel, with the
bright red flames gushing out from her hatchways,
and flickering up the masts and spars.
</p>

<p>
As the veil of smoke thinned, we suddenly got
a glimpse of a felucca, hitherto concealed by it, and
to leeward of the vessel.  When we first saw her she
was edging away from the wreck, with a boat towing
astern, rather an unusual thing at sea.  Presently,
she hoisted it up, and kept by the wind after us, as if
she had taken time to reconnoitre, and had at length
made up her mind to overhaul us.  As the wreck
was by this time burned to the water's edge, it was
clear we could render no assistance; we therefore
made all the sail we could, and stood once more on
our course.  Just as we had hauled by the wind, the
after-part of the quarterdeck of the burning vessel
lifted, as it were, but by no means suddenly; although
the stump of the mizen-mast flew up into the sky
like a javelin launched from the hands of a giant;
and clouds of white smoke burst from the hull,
in the midst of which a sudden spout of red flame
shot up; but there was scarcely any report, at least
what sound we heard was more a deadened <i>thud</i> than
a sharp explosion.  The unfortunate hooker
immediately fell over on her side, and vanished suddenly
below the green waves, in a cloud of white steam.
</p>

<p>
"There's a gallant craft come to an untimely
end," said the captain.
</p>

<p>
"You may say that," I rejoined; "and that roguish-looking
little fellow to leeward has had some hand
in her destruction, or I am mistaken&mdash;see if the
villain has not hauled his wind, and made all the sail he
can pack on her after us.  Had you not better keep
by the wind, Mr Hause, and try if you can't shake
him off on a bowline."
</p>

<p>
The hint was taken.  We made all sail on the
larboard tack, steadying the leeches well out, and
although the felucca did the same, it was clear we
were dropping her fast.
</p>

<p>
"Give me the glass," said I.  "I had strong
suspicions that I knew that chap before&mdash;let me
see&mdash;ay, it is her, true enough.  I know the new cloth in
the afterleech of the mainsail there&mdash;there, about
half-way up&mdash;but heyday&mdash;that sail was as good as
new, notwithstanding, when I last saw it, but it
seems strangely patched now&mdash;this must be meant as
a mask."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, sir," said the skipper, "do you know that
vessel?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure I do&mdash;it is the Midge&mdash;my old friend
the Midge, as I am a sinner, and no other&mdash;She that
was tender to the Gazelle the other day&mdash;the little
felucca sold out of the service at Havanna before we
sailed.  I cannot be deceived; but she must be
strangely out of trim."
</p>

<p>
All the Spanish passengers were by this time
on deck, peering out through their telescopes at the
little vessel.
</p>

<p>
"What can keep her astern in that manner?"
continued I; "she seems under all sail, yet you are
leaving her hand-over-hand, and that is more than
you should do, fast as you say you are, were she
properly handled."
</p>

<p>
"Why," said the master joyously, "you don't
know the qualifications of this craft, sir"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Probably not," said I.
</p>

<p>
"We are creeping away beautifully," continued
he.  "I always knew the Ballahoo had a clever pair
of heels, if there was any wind at all&mdash;poo, the Midge
at her best could not have touched us, take my word
for it, Mr Brail&mdash;keep her full and by, my lad"&mdash;to
the man at the helm&mdash;"let her walk through it&mdash;do
you hear?&mdash;we shall show that felucca that she has
no chance with us."
</p>

<p>
I handed the glass to the skipper again.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you see something towing astern yonder,
as she falls off, and comes up to the wind again?"
</p>

<p>
"Faith I do," said he, in a hurried and somewhat
disconcerted tone; a sudden light seeming to flash on
him; "I see a long dark object in her wake, as she
rises on the swell&mdash;what can it be?"
</p>

<p>
"What say you to its being the spanker-boom, or
a spare topmast of the vessel we saw on fire, for
instance?" said I; "at all events, you see it is a
spar of some sort or another, and it can only be there
for one purpose, to keep her astern, while she desires
to appear to be carrying all sail, and going a-head as
fast as she can; it is a common trick amongst these
piratical craft, I know."
</p>

<p>
The man, with a melancholy shake of his head,
coincided with me.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said I, "listen to me.  I know that felucca
well," and here I told him how, and what time I had
been on board of her&mdash;"if she casts off that drag,
she will be alongside of you in a crack.  In light
winds and a smooth sea, she is the fastest thing I ever
saw; you have no chance if you trust to your heels;
so, take my advice, and shorten sail boldly at once;
get all your passengers on deck with their trabucos;
clear away your guns and double-shot them, and see
all ready for action.  If you appear prepared she will
not bother you&mdash;it is not her cue to fight, unless
she cannot help it&mdash;at any rate, if you don't frighten
her off, I see she will stick by you all day, and be
alongside whether <i>you will or no</i> when the night falls;
so the sooner you give him a glimpse of your charms
the better, take my word for it."
</p>

<p>
My advice was so palpably prudent, that it was
instantly followed.
</p>

<p>
"Valga me Dios!" exclaimed one of our Spanish
passengers&mdash;"que gente hay abordo&mdash;gracias a Dios,
que este felucha no puede andar; porque hombre
honesto no lo es."&mdash;(Heaven help me, what a number
of people there are on board&mdash;we should be thankful
that that felucca can't sail, as she is not honest, that's
clear.)
</p>

<p>
Another shouted out&mdash;"Tanto gente&mdash;tanto gente!"  (Lord
what a number of people&mdash;what a number of people!)
</p>

<p>
"People!" exclaimed the skipper, laughing, as he
slammed the joints of the glass into each other;
"why, it is a deck-load of cattle, or I am a
Dutchman.  Oh dear&mdash;oh dear&mdash;why, gentlemen, your
courage has all been thrown away&mdash;she is some
Montego bay trader with a cargo of dyewood, and
'ganado,' as you call them&mdash;ha&mdash;ha&mdash;ha!"
</p>

<p>
"And so it is," said I, much amused, and not
a little rejoiced.  "Come, gentlemen, your warlike
demonstrations have indeed been thrown away, and I
suppose our friend the skipper there may secure his
guns when he likes, and keep away on his course
again."
</p>

<p>
This was done, and every thing subsided into its
usual quietness, except the jaw of the Dons as to
the astonishing feats <i>they never would have
performed</i>; for they were all silent enough, and Bob
Acreish enough, so long as we had suspicions of the
felucca; but every man among them was braver than
another the moment they saw that their fears had
been groundless.  They now all began singing, and
shouting, and swaggering about the decks, bristling
with pistols and knives, like so many porcupines, while
I was taking a careless, and, what I considered, a
parting squint at the vessel.  When I put my head over
the high bulwark, I naturally looked out astern, as we
had by this time kept away, and were going along free,
in expectation of seeing him still close by the wind;
but, to my great surprise, no such thing&mdash;the youth
although no nearer than before, in place of being by
this time in our wake, had kept away also, and was
now on our lee-quarter, sailing two knots for one he
had been going before, and as if desirous of cutting us
off.  "I say, skipper, I don't like this manoeuvring on
the part of the felucca&mdash;she is off the wind again."
</p>

<p>
"And so she is," said the man.
</p>

<p>
The Spaniards gathered from our countenances, I
suppose, that doubts had again sprung up in our
minds as to the character of the vessel, notwithstanding
the improbability of a pirate carrying a deck-load
of cattle;&mdash;so they stopped their exclamations in
mid-volley, breaking off their patriotic songs with
laughable quickness, and began to bustle with their
glasses again.
</p>

<p>
My original suggestion was once more the order of
the day, and after seeing all clear for the second time,
the skipper manfully handed his top-gallant sails,
hauled up his courses, and took a reef in his topsails.
The felucca had now no alternative but to come
alongside; so she gradually drew up on our lee-quarter,
so that, as the breeze laid her over, we might see
as little of her deck as possible.  We could now
perceive that she had cast off the spar she had been
towing astern.  Ticklish as our situation had become,
my nautical enthusiasm fairly got the better of me, as
the little beauty ranged alongside.
</p>

<p>
"Look, captain&mdash;look, man&mdash;how blandly she bends
before the breeze, as if she would melt into the water
like a snowflake, yet she never careens over an inch
beyond that mark on her goldbright copper; and how
gracefully she always rights again.  See what an entry
she has&mdash;not the smallest surge, or curl of a wave at
her bows.  Her sharp stem cuts into it as clean as a
knife, while there is not one single drop of dead
water under the counter.  Mortal man never saw a
cleaner run&mdash;how mildly she skims along, and yet
how fast&mdash;the very gushes from the rudder <i>swirl</i> and
meander away astern mellifluously.&mdash;Oh, murder, if
the sweet little thing does not slide along as smoothly
as if the sea were oil!"
</p>

<p>
When she came within hail, she hauled the foresheet
to windward, and sent a small punt of a boat, pulled
by two men, on board, with a curious sallow-complexioned
little monkey of a Spaniard in the stern.  He
came on deck, grimacing like an ape; and although
I could perceive that he was carefully noting our
strength and preparations with the corner of his eye,
he seemed all blandness and civility.
</p>

<p>
"What vessel is that?" said the captain.
</p>

<p>
"The Mosquito," was the answer.
</p>

<p>
Here the little fellow looked very hard at me.
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said the skipper, "she is the English
tender that was sold the other day in Havanna."
</p>

<p>
"The same," said the baboon, evidently put out
by the recognition, but not venturing to deny the
fact; "she was called de Midge den, dat is Anglis
for Mosquito."
</p>

<p>
"Come, there is honesty in that confession at all
events," thought I; but I presently was convinced
that the fellow knew me, and, what was more, saw
that I had recognised his vessel&mdash;so his game, if he
wished to throw snuff in our eyes, was clearly to take
credit for candour.  However, I was as yet by no
means satisfied of his quality.  For instance, he gave
a blundering account of the reason why they had
clapped patches of old canvass on a new sail; and he
positively denied having had a spar towing astern to
deaden her way&mdash;thus telling a deliberate lie.  As to
the vessel we had seen on fire, he said they knew
nothing of her; that they had fallen in with her
accidentally as we had done; and that, so far as they
knew, her crew had previously taken to their boats,
for there was no one on board of her, when they
passed her, that they could perceive.  He finished the
parley by saying that he was bound to Falmouth, to
dispose of his cargo of Nicaragua wood and cattle, and
that he had come on board for some water, as they had
run short, and had little left, except some pond water
for the bestias.
</p>

<p>
He got a small cask filled, and then, with a
repetition of his grimaces, walked over the side.
Immediately on his getting on board, the felucca hauled by
the wind until she got dead in our wake, where she
hung for some time; but I could see they had the
greatest difficulty in keeping her astern, by luffing up
in the wind one moment&mdash;then letting her fall broad
off, and sheering her about every way but the right
one.  At length he took his departure.
</p>

<p>
"Had you not cut such a formidable appearance,
Mr Hause, you would have been treated very
unceremoniously by that gentleman, take my word for it,"
said I.
</p>

<p>
"You may say that, sir," said the skipper; "but
I hope we are now finally quit of him."
</p>

<p>
That same evening, about ten o'clock, I was sitting
in the cabin with the master of the vessel.  The
cabin had two state-rooms, as they are called in
merchantmen, opening off it, one on each side of the
door, and four open berths aft, shut in with green
baize curtains, that ran on brass rods.  Each of the
beds was tenanted by a Spanish passenger, while the
master and I slept in cots slung in the main cabin.
The Dons, tired with the exploits of the day, had
by this time all bestowed themselves in their nests,
and, so far as we could judge by the nasal chorus
going on, were sound asleep.  On a sudden we heard
the mate, who appeared to be standing aft beside the
man at the wheel, hail some one forward.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that standing on the rail at the gang-way there?"
</p>

<p>
Some one answered, but we could not make out
what was said.
</p>

<p>
The mate again spoke&mdash;"whereabouts do you see it?"
</p>

<p>
"There, sir&mdash;right to windward there."
</p>

<p>
We then heard a bustle in the companion, as if
some one was groping for the glass; and in a minute
the mate came down to the cabin with it in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"There is a strange sail to windward of us, sir."
</p>

<p>
"What does she look like?" said the skipper;
"not that infernal felucca again?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir," said the man.  "I think she is a large
schooner; but it is so thick and dark, that I cannot
be certain."
</p>

<p>
"I'll bet a thousand," said I, "that old Dogvane
was right after all; and that this infernal little Midge,
that has been buzzing round us all day, will have
enacted the jackal to the lion, and brought this big
fellow upon us."
</p>

<p>
We rose and went on deck, and saw the object to
windward clearly enough.  She appeared to be dodging
us; and when we kept away, or luffed up in the
wind, she instantly manoeuvred in the same fashion,
so soon as she perceived we were altering our
position from her.
</p>

<p>
"Come, <i>that</i> fellow is watching us, at any rate,"
said the captain, "whatever the felucca may have
done.  I wish we were fairly round Cape Antonio.
I fear there is some concert between the two.  Mr
Crosjack," to his mate, "keep a bright look-out&mdash;keep
your eye on him, until I take a look at the chart
below: he seems determined to jam us on the Florida
shore.  Surely the current is stronger than I have
allowed for, or we should have made more of it by
this time than we have done."
</p>

<p>
Curiosity led me to accompany the skipper below,
and we were both poring over the chart, when the
mate called down&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The schooner has bore up for us, sir, and is
coming down like an arrow on our weather-quarter."
</p>

<p>
"The devil she is!" said the skipper, dashing
down his compasses and parallel ruler with such
vehemence, that the former were driven through the
chart, and stuck quivering in the table on one-leg,
like an opera-dancer; then slamming on his hat, he
jumped up the ladder.
</p>

<p>
This startled the Dons.  The curtains in front of
the side-berths were drawn aside with a jarring rasp
of the brass rings along the rods, and four half-naked
Spaniards, with their-nightcaps on, and their gold or
silver crucifixes, like glow-worms in moss (Lord! what
a fantastical image), glancing on their hairy
chests in the candle-light, sat up; while the inmates
of the two state-rooms stretched their necks to look
into the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"Que&mdash;que&mdash;buque a barlovento?"&mdash;(What is
it?&mdash;what&mdash;a vessel to windward?)
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I; "there is a strange sail after us,
and dodging us rather suspiciously."
</p>

<p>
"Sospechoso! sospechoso!&mdash;buque sospechoso!&mdash;Ave
Maria!"&mdash;and forthwith the whole lot of warriors
jumped out of bed; and great was the confusion
that arose while busy decorating themselves.  One
poor fellow, half asleep, turned his trowsers the wrong
way, as if he were going to sail stern foremost, like a
Dutch schuyet.  Another stuck a leg into his own
galligaskins right enough; while his neighbour, half
asleep, had appropriated the other branch of the
subject, whereby they both lost their balance, and fell
down in this Irish manacle on their noses on the
cabin floor; "carrajoing," and spurring each other in
great wrath.
</p>

<p>
The alarm in the brig had now become general,
and half-a-dozen more of our passengers came
tumbling down the companion-ladder, having left their
quarters in the steerage, as if their chance of safety
had been greater in the cabin; and such a jumble of
shouting, and cursing, and praying, I never heard
before; some of them calling to the steward to open
the hatch in the cabin floor, in order to stow away
their treasure in the run, others bustling with their
trabucos; some fixing flints, others ramming down
the bullets before the cartridges, when&mdash;crack&mdash;one
of their pieces went off in the confusion, and filled
the cabin with smoke, through which I could see
several of my allies prostrate on the floor; having
fallen down in a panic of fear.
</p>

<p>
Finding that the danger from one's friends below
was, if not greater than what threatened on deck, yet
sufficiently startling, I left them to shoot each other
at their leisure.  By this time there was neither moon
nor stars to be seen, and the haze that hung on the
water, although there was a fine breeze, and we were
going along about seven knots, made every thing so
indistinct, that it was some time before I could catch
the object again.  At length I saw her; but as she
was stem on, edging down on us, I could not make
out more than that she was a large fore-and-aft rigged
vessel, decidedly not the Midge.  When she had crept
up within hail, she brailed up her foresail, and, under
her mainsail and jib, appeared to have no difficulty in
maintaining her position on our weather-quarter,
although we had set every inch of canvas that would
draw.  There was no light on board, and it was too
dark to distinguish any one on her decks.  Our
master was evidently puzzled what to do; at length,
seizing the trumpet, he hailed the strange sail.
</p>

<p>
"What schooner is that?"
</p>

<p>
"The Julia of Baltimore," was the prompt answer.
</p>

<p>
"Where are you bound for?"
</p>

<p>
"Vera Cruz."
</p>

<p>
A long pause, during which she was gradually
edging nearer and nearer.  "Don't come any closer, or
I will fire into you," sung out our skipper; and then,
to me, "He'll be on board of us, sir, if we do not
mind."
</p>

<p>
"No, no," was the laconic reply, as our persecutor
luffed up in the wind; but he soon kept away
again until he was right astern, and there he stuck,
to our great discomfort, the whole blessed night,
yawing about in our wake as if just to keep out of
hail.  We passed, as may well be imagined, a very
anxious night of it; at length day dawned, and we
could see about us, but as if to baulk us, as the light
increased, the schooner shortened sail still more, and
steered more steadily, so that we were prevented from
seeing what was going on upon deck; at length, at
eight o'clock A.M., he set his foresail, and in ten minutes
was again in his old position to windward of us.
We were all at quarters once more; even the Dons,
finding that there was no alternative, had determined
to fight, and as he gradually edged down, I asked the
skipper what he thought of it.  "I really don't know;
I see no one on deck but the man steering, and that
fellow sitting on the lee bulwark there, with his arm
round the backstay, apparently watching us."
</p>

<p>
"She does not seem to have any guns," said
I.  By this time the schooner, a long low vessel,
painted black, with a white streak, had crept up so
close on our weather quarter, that by keeping away a
couple of points, he could in half a minute have run
his jib-boom over our tafferel.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't haul off," sung out the captain, "I
will fire into you."  At this, there was a rush of men
from below up the schooner's hatchways, and her
decks were in a trice covered with them.  The next
moment she kept by the wind, as if determined to
bring us dead to leeward.  There was now no doubt
of her real character, so the captain seized the helm,
and luffed up across his bows so suddenly, that I
thought he had carried away his jib-boom, but he was
as quick as we were, and by keeping away, cleared us,
just shaving our stern; but not before he got our
broadside of cannon and musketry plump into his
bows.  So great was his confusion, that he lost his
opportunity of raking us in passing to leeward.  As
the brig came to the wind, the schooner shot a-head,
when, by a dexterous management of the yards, the
former was backed astern.  "Give him the other
broadside, and blaze away, you Spanish villains,"
shouted the Skipper; he thus got t'other dose right
into his stern, and we could see his reception had been
far more surprising than pleasant, for our fire was only
returned by an ill-directed volley of musketry, that
injured no one.  The few English sailors we had on
board continued to ply the carronades, as he again
drew a-head, and the Dons their trabucos, the latter
always cowering below the brig's bulwarks while
loading, then popping up their heads and letting drive,
sometimes at the enemy, at other times into the air,
as if they had been shooting sea-gulls.  At length, one
of them was hit by a chance shot from the schooner,
which was the signal for the whole lot to run below.
Our friend having shot a-head out of gun-shot by this
time, now hauled by the wind, and once more shortened
sail; presently, as if he had gathered fresh courage,
he came down again,&mdash;this time, from his preparations,
with an evident intention of boarding us: and since
the evaporation of our Spanish allies, there is not the
least doubt but he would have carried us, when, "a
sail right a-head," sung out by one of the crew at this
most critical juncture, revived our spirits again.  As
if the schooner had seen her at the same moment,
she instantly sheered off, hauled her wind, and made
all sail on a bowline.
</p>

<p>
We continued on our course, under every stitch we
could crowd, and in half an hour had the pleasure to
see the vessel which was standing towards us hoist a
British ensign and pennant&mdash;presently she hailed us,
when we found she was the Spider schooner, belonging
to the Jamaica station, who, on being made
acquainted with the nature of the attack, and the
character of the vessel on our weather beam, immediately
made all sail in chase, but, unfortunately, she had no
chance; and in the afternoon we had the discomfort
of seeing her bear up and come down to us, the other
vessel being out of sight dead to windward.

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
</h3>

<h4>
SPIRITING AWAY&mdash;WHERE IS THE BALLAHOO?
</h4>

<p>
The lieutenant commanding the Spider came on
board, and finding we were bound for Kingston,
strongly recommended our not attempting it alone, as
he said privateers were swarming between it and the
west end of Jamaica; but, on hearing that, although,
the Ballahoo was bound for Kingston, my destination
was the north side of the island, he politely said, that,
although bound for Havanna, he would himself see us
into Montego bay, where the brig might remain until
the coast was clear, or she could get convoy.  This
was too good an offer to be rejected, and we
accordingly hauled our wind, and made all sail in company.
</p>

<p>
We, the master, his mate, and myself, were sitting
at dinner in the cabin on that same afternoon, the
Spanish gentry preferring to eat their garlic and
"bacallao" and oil on the deck.
</p>

<p>
"I was glad to see your servant out of his hammock
and on deck again to-day.  He is a smart chap that,
and managed the small-arm party exceedingly well.
He seems quite at home with the musket, I assure
you, sir."
</p>

<p>
I laid down my knife and fork at this speech of the
captain.
</p>

<p>
"My servant&mdash;<i>my</i> servant, did you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir;&mdash;did you not notice how well he behaved
on the forecastle, when the schooner was drawing
a-head of us?"
</p>

<p>
I had noticed a black fellow, in an old red jacket,
very active certainly during the brush, and especially
the coolness and expertness with which he had fired;
but I little dreamed who it was.
</p>

<p>
"Pray," said I to the skipper, "do me the favour
to desire the man to come aft here."
</p>

<p>
Straightway, who, of all the fish in the sea, should
appear before my wondering eyes, but our old friend
Serjeant Quacco!  There was a pause, my dingy
adherent keeping his vantage ground at the cabin-door,
as if unwilling to trust himself within arm's length,
until he knew how the land lay, and endeavouring to
look very modest and sheepish; but his assumed
bashfulness was but a flimsy cloak to his native impudence.
</p>

<p>
"Quacco," said I, in anger;&mdash;but before I could
get a word out&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"<i>Serjeant</i> Quacco, if massa will be so good as
remember."
</p>

<p>
"You impudent rascal," continued I, "how dare
you smuggle yourself on board as my servant, and
without my knowledge, after having told me that you
had entered on board Gazelle?"
</p>

<p>
"Massa, do hab a leetle patient, and massa shall
know every ting.&mdash;You see, massa, I was mind, as
massa say, to sarve on board de Commodo&mdash;massa say
de trute in dat&mdash;but dat was de time when I was tink
de brigand knife had top massa him promotion."
</p>

<p>
"Cool, and deliciously modest," thought I, as
Quacco continued, in nowise put out,
</p>

<p>
"But when I yeerie dat massa not only was like
to cover" (recover, I surmised, was meant), "but
dat he was nephew to one big somebody, wid plenty
money, and, beside all dat, he was to go to Jamaica&mdash;oh
dat alter Quacco taught altogeder, becaase he
knowed he could be much use to massa in Jamaica, from,
him knowledge of de world dere."&mdash;("Indeed!"
thought I, "how very disinterested!")&mdash;"Beside,"
seeing I twigged, "to tell de hanest trute,&mdash;one ting
wery <i>pleasant</i> for do when him <i>profitable at de same
time</i>,&mdash;I taught it more better to take my chance wid
you as my master, den face de <i>sartainty</i> of hard work,
leetle sleep, and much flag, in de frigate&mdash;so I take de
small liberty of ship myself in de Ballahoo lang wid
good massa&mdash;dat all, massa."
</p>

<p>
"So&mdash;and pray where have you been skulking
since we sailed, may I ask?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure," said he, with the most provoking
calmness,&mdash;"to be sure."
</p>

<p>
"To be sure of what, sir?" said I, fairly savage at
last.
</p>

<p>
"To be sure massa may hax where I have been
since we sailed," roared Quacco, withdrawing up the
ladder from the door as I rose&mdash;"Devil I don't I say,
if massa will only sit down again, dat I will tell him,
and satisfy him on all particular."
</p>

<p>
He uttered this with his head leant back, so as to
be the only part of him visible, while his hands clutched
the ropes of the companion-ladder, his feet being on
the second step of it, in act to bolt on deck if I had
moved after him.  I sat down, seeing there was no
use in putting myself into a passion with the poor fellow.
</p>

<p>
"Well, do tell me then, you free-and-easy scoundrel you."
</p>

<p>
Here the serjeant again advanced into the cabin,
where he made a variety of grimaces; and after
rubbing his great blubber lips hard with the back of his
hand, he proceeded:&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"You see, sir&mdash;it was no fault of I&mdash;some how,
when I turn in, I hab one larsh case-bottle of rum
wid me, and I could not finis him in lesser time den
tree day,&mdash;so dat was de reason massa did not see me
more sooner; but de moment I hear enemy was dere&mdash;dat
fighting was for do&mdash;ha, ha!&mdash;Quacco sober in
one moment, and I jomp up, and lef de bottle one tird
full, and fight!&mdash;Massa surely see how I was fight!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay,&mdash;and, with Mr Brail's permission, you shall
have a free passage for your gallantry, Quacco," said
the skipper.
</p>

<p>
"Tank you, massa captain," quoth Quacco,
joyously.&mdash;"Now, Massa Brail, you must forgive de
leetle liberty I was take&mdash;believe me, you hab got
one gooder sarvant more as you taught,"&mdash;and so I
did indeed find afterwards.
</p>

<p>
Six days after this, the man-of-war schooner, having
seen us safe to the end of our voyage, left us for
her destination, and we ran into Montego bay as the
night fell, and came to anchor.
</p>

<p>
Right above us, on the larboard hand, perched on a
bold rock, stood a large and very handsome house, a
very conspicuous object from the offing, and
commanding the entrance to the bay, as it were, which,
by half-past eight, when I was going on shore to the
tavern, where I intended to sojourn for the night,
began to be brilliantly lit up; I could hear preparatory
strains of music, and other tokens of revelry, as if a
ball or some other piece of gaiety were toward.
</p>

<p>
There is something striking in being suddenly
withdrawn from prowling on the "melancholy main,"
and plunged into the vortex of civilized life.  The
very jabber of the negroes startled me more than I had
allowed for, as I landed on the wharf, an old rickety
wooden fabric, and accosted a tall man in white
trowsers and jacket, who was walking up and down upon
it, to enquire where the best tavern or lodging-house
was situated.  He very civilly not only gave me the
desired information, but accompanied me as pilot; so
that I soon found myself in the dark piazza of a large
building, which had any thing but the look of a place
of public resort.  An open balcony ran along the
front next the street, to which you ascended by
five or six steps, with a common unpainted wooden
rail, to prevent your toppling over into the thoroughfare.
Beyond this there was a gloomy dungeon of an
interior chamber, apparently wainscoted with some
sort of dark-coloured hardwood, and lighted by one
solitary unsnuffed tallow candle, glimmering on a long
mahogany table covered with slops, and wet marks, as
if glasses had recently been removed, the whole
redolent of the strong smell of tobacco smoke and brandy
punch.  There appeared to be bedrooms opening off
the hall at each end.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo!&mdash;house!" shouted I, as no one appeared
when I entered;&mdash;"house!"
</p>

<p>
A tall decently-dressed brown woman&mdash;lady, beg
her pardon&mdash;at this presented herself at the farther
door of the large room fronting the one at which I
stood&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hose!&mdash;hose!&mdash;what you want wid de hose?"
</p>

<p>
"I am a traveller," said I, "just landed, and want
some supper and a bed."
</p>

<p>
"Supper and a bed," said the old lady,&mdash;"sartainly,
you shall have dem.  But&mdash;beg pardon, sir&mdash;I hear
no noise of horse or sarvant, so I was tink you might
have been <i>walking buccra</i>,[<a id="chap06fn1text"></a><a href="#chap06fn1">1</a>] and I never allow dem
sort of peoples to put dere nose into my hose.  But
here I see sailor carrying in your luggage," as the
master of the brig, whom I had invited to sup with
me, came up the front steps of the piazza, followed by
one of his crew, and Serjeant Quacco, carrying my
traps.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn1text">1</a>] A most opprobrious appellation in Jamaica, as nothing, in the
eyes of the coloured and black population, seems so degrading to
a white man as the being compelled to travel on foot.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We were now treated with abundant civility, and
soon were enjoying ourselves over an excellent repast.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Mrs&mdash;I forget your name."
</p>

<p>
"Sally Frenche, an please, massa."
</p>

<p>
"Sally Frenche!" said I;&mdash;"ho, ho, I am in
soundings here, mayhap&mdash;Pray, do you know old Mr
Lathom Frenche, my good lady&mdash;a rich old chap, who
lives somewhere hereabout, at a place called
Ballywindle?"
</p>

<p>
My simple enquiry appeared to have an electrical
effect, and at the same time to have given some
unaccountable and serious offence;&mdash;for my talkative
hostess, a deuced buxom-looking dingy dame, of some
forty years or so, now drew herself up, and crossed
her arms, looking as prim as mustard at me, as she
slowly grumbled out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Do&mdash;me&mdash;Sally Frenche&mdash;know&mdash;one&mdash;reesh&mdash;old&mdash;chap&mdash;dem
call&mdash;Massa Latom Frenche&mdash;who&mdash;live&mdash;at
one place somewhere hereabout&mdash;dat dem
call Ballywindle?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said I, a good deal surprised at the tone
and manner in which she drawled out her words&mdash;"I
mean no offence&mdash;I ask you a plain question&mdash;Do you
know Mr Lathom Frenche of Ballywindle?  I am a
near relation of his, and desirous of engaging horses,
or some kind of conveyance, to proceed to his house
in the morning."
</p>

<p>
She here came round to the side of the table where
I sat, shoving the black servant who had been
waiting on us away so forcibly, that he spun into the
corner of the room, with an exclamation of&mdash;"Heigh,
misses, wurra dat for?"&mdash;and shading her eyes from
the glare of the candles with her hand, she fell to
perusing my face in a way that was any thing but
pleasant.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha&mdash;Sally Frenche know something&mdash;I
see&mdash;I see&mdash;you must be de <i>nyung buccra</i>, Massa Latom is
look out for so hanxious&mdash;so tell me, is you really
and truly Massa Benjamin Brail, old Massa nephew?"
</p>

<p>
"I am certainly that gentleman, old lady."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Hold</i> ladee, indeed&mdash;Ah, Jacka&mdash;but never mind.
You is my family, and so you is&mdash;but don't call me
<i>hold</i> lady, if you please, again, <i>nyung massa</i>.  Let me
see&mdash;you hab him mout, and him nose, and de wery
cack of him yeye.  Oh dear, you is Massa Benjamin,
for true you is de leetle boy dat de old man look out
for so long&mdash;here, Teemoty, Peeta, Daroty&mdash;here is
your cosin, Massa Benjamin&mdash;Oh, massa neger, I am
so happy"&mdash;and she began to roll about the room,
sprawling with her feet, and walloping her arms about,
seizing hold of a chair here, and a table there, as if
the excess of her joy, and the uproariousness of her
laughter, had driven her beside herself.
</p>

<p>
At her call two tall, young mulatto fellows, with
necks like cranes, and bushy heads like the long brooms
used to clean staircases, without stockings or
neckcloths, dressed in white duck trowsers, and blue
coatees, and a very pretty, well-dressed brown girl, of
about eighteen, presented themselves at the door of
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, who are those?" said I, during a lull of
the matron's paroxysm.
</p>

<p>
"Who dem is? why your own cosin&mdash;your own
flesh and blood&mdash;your oncle, God bless him&mdash;him
children dem is, all&mdash;ay, every one on dem."
</p>

<p>
"And who is their mamma?" said I&mdash;"Not you, ma'am?"
</p>

<p>
"Me&mdash;oh dear, de poor boy don't know noting
about him own relation&mdash;No&mdash;I is Sally Frenche,
daughter of old Terrence Frenche, your oncle dat
was die five year ago&mdash;he who leave all his money to
his broder, Mr Latom Frenche.  I is his only daughter,
and your cosin, and kind fader he was to me."
</p>

<p>
"Well, kinswoman, I am glad to see you; but are
these really my cousins? and again I ask, who is their
mamma?"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha&mdash;you really know noting, none at all.
Dere mamma, as you call <i>him</i>, is dead lang time; but
come here&mdash;come here&mdash;dem is Teemoty&mdash;hold up
your head, you poppy dag&mdash;and Peeta, all two Massa
Latom sons&mdash;bote your own cosin, I no tell you?"
</p>

<p>
"And that pretty young lady&mdash;who is she?"
</p>

<p>
"Ha, ha, ha&mdash;Oh dear, oh dear!&mdash;why, him is
Miss Daroty, dere sister."
</p>

<p>
"And a devilish pretty girl she is, let me tell you.
Why, Dorothy, give me a kiss, my fair cousin."  And
as I gave her a hearty smack, she dropped me a
low curtsy.
</p>

<p>
"Tank you, cosin Benjamin."
</p>

<p>
Our friend the skipper was all this time taking his
cargo on board with great industry, only stealing a
passing squint at us now and then; and I was beginning
to think it was high time to put in my oar also,
lest I should go without my meal, when a great bustle
was heard in the street&mdash;first a trampling as of a
squadron of dragoons, then the rattling and grinding
of carriage wheels through the sandy roads, and a loud
gabbling of negroes.  Presently some one whistled loud
and shrill on his fingers, and a voice called out&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Why, Sally Frenche&mdash;Sally&mdash;where the devil are
you, and all your people, Sally?"
</p>

<p>
"Massa Jacob Twig, sure as can be," cried Sally,
and again the hysterical laugh seemed to carry her
beyond herself.  "All my friend come on me at one
time.  What shall me Sally do?&mdash;Teemoty, tell Parot-toe
for kill de kidd, and de two capon, and de wile
dock, dem [<i>anglice</i>, wild-duck], and&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;oh,
tell him for kill every ting him can lay him ogly
paw upon."
</p>

<p>
"Den," quoth Timothy with a grin, "I shall keep
out of de way, misses."
</p>

<p>
"Sally"&mdash;shouted the same impatient voice from
the street again.
</p>

<p>
"Coming, Massa Jacob&mdash;Oh, dear!&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"&mdash;and
as some one now entered the dark piazza, she
ran out, and stumbled against him; and knocking his
hat off, in her flourishing, she fairly clasped her arms
round the person's neck for support during her
violent and extraordinary cachinnations.  "Oh, Massa
Jacob, sweet Massa Jacob, I so glad to see you."
</p>

<p>
"Why, old lady, you appear so, certainly; but
come, come, you must be bewitched," said the
stranger, shaking her off.  "Do gather your wits about
you, and desire your people to see my horses cared
for; and get us some supper, <i>do you hear</i>?"&mdash;the
words in Italics pronounced with a strange emphasis,
and a very peculiar accent, as if they had been
twisted out angrily from between the compressed lips.
</p>

<p>
Here the speaker caught my eye: he bowed.
</p>

<p>
"Good evening, sir.  I hope I am not disturbing
you, gentlemen."
</p>

<p>
"Not in the least," said I.  "We are strangers
just landed from the brig that came in this evening;
and as our hostess and I here happen, to my great
surprise, to be relations, her joy has shoved her a
little off her balance, as you see?"
</p>

<p>
"Balance!" said the person addressed, with a
good-natured smile&mdash;"Sally Frenche was never very
famous for keeping her balance."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Massa Jacob," said the placable Sally, "how
can you say so?"
</p>

<p>
"But you are her relation you say, sir," continued
the stranger; and here he turned round as if
recollecting himself, and stuck his head through the
window that looked into the piazza.  Addressing some
one who was tumbling portmanteaus and luggage
about there&mdash;"I say, Felix, he can't be a brown chap,
eh?&mdash;he don't look like it."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo! what if he be?" said the person
spoken to&mdash;"What if he be?&mdash;order supper, man&mdash;curse
this portmanteau! the straps are as stiff as iron
hoops, and have broken my nails.  You villain,
Twister, why don't you come and help me, that I may get
out my clothes?"
</p>

<p>
"Here, massa," said a blackie from the street, and
the gentleman who had spoken now entered.
</p>

<p>
Sally had asked leave for the new comers to join
our party, and as this might be according to rule in
Jamaica, we consented of course, and they were
presently seated at the same board.
</p>

<p>
The shortest of the two was a stout, sun-burned
man, about thirty, with a round face, but a fine white
forehead, and beautiful clustering brown hair.  He was
dressed in very short nankeen trowsers, very much
faded, silk stockings, and shoes&mdash;rather an out-of-the-way
rig for a traveller through dirty roads, as it struck
me; and wore a long French-cut blue military frock
or pelisse, garnished with a perfect plague of frogs.
</p>

<p>
This was largely open at the breast, displaying a
magnificent whitish-blue cambric frill, while a
neckcloth, with a strong dash of the same indigo shade,
was twisted round his bull neck as gracefully as a
collar round a mastiff's; while, above it, the peaks of
his shirt stood up in such pomp of starch and stiffness,
that I could not help considering his ears in some
peril.  When he entered, he had replaced the small,
narrow-brimmed, glazed hat, that had been knocked
off by Sally in her paroxysm; the oily appearance of
which, in such a climate, was enough to make one
perspire, and rolled in, quite at home apparently, with
a hand stuck into each side-pocket.  Altogether he
looked like a broiled man; but when he sat down at
table, I was refreshed by noticing that his hands were
beautifully white; and, according to Lord Byron's
maxim, I took this as a kind of voucher, for want of
a better, that the nondescript was a gentleman.  His
companion was a tall, thin, dark, young fellow,
apparently about twenty-five or twenty-six years of age,
with short, curly, fair hair, dressed in white jean
pantaloons, with long Hessian boots drawn up over them
to his knees, white waistcoat and neckcloth, and a
blue coat.  There was nothing peculiar about his
appearance.  We all carried on for some time in silence.
At length the shortest of my new acquaintances
asked me to drink wine with him.
</p>

<p>
"Your good health, sir.  Here's to our better acquaintance."
</p>

<p>
"Massa Jacob," quoth Mammy Sally, who was
superintending the attendance of her servants, with a
knowing look, "you know who you drink wine wid?"
</p>

<p>
Mr Twig looked round at her with an expression
efface as if he neither knew nor cared.
</p>

<p>
"Ha, I see&mdash;you tink you know every ting, Massa
Jacob, but&mdash;but&mdash;oh dear, oh dear&mdash;you no
know&mdash;you no know?&mdash;why it is Massa Benjamin
himself&mdash;Massa Benjamin Brail, dat old Massa Latom
so long for see."
</p>

<p>
Massa Jacob at this rose, with his table napkin in
his hand, and first looking steadfastly at me,
munching all the time, and then regarding the old lady,
with his mouth full, he stretched his hand across the
table to me.
</p>

<p>
"If you be Mr Brail, I am particularly rejoiced to
see you.  Your uncle, young gentleman, is my most
especial friend; and there is not a worthier man
breathing.  I knew you were expected; and as I am
bound, with Mr Felix Flamingo there, on a visit to
Mr Frenche&mdash;Mr Flamingo, Mr Brail&mdash;Mr Brail,
Mr Flamingo, of the extensive Kingston firm of
Peaweep, Snipe, and Flamingo&mdash;ahem&mdash;as I was saying,
we are bound on a visit to this very identical uncle of
yours.  So nothing could have been more opportune
than our meeting."
</p>

<p>
"Flamingo,&mdash;Peaweep, and Flamingo?" said I to
myself; "My uncle Peter's agents, by all that is
fortunate!  Come, this will do.  But whom have I the
honour of addressing?" said I, turning to the
red-faced man, not a little startled at such sudden
cordiality on the part of a stranger.
</p>

<p>
"My name is Jacob Twig, of the Dream, in the
parish of St Thomas in the East, at your service;
and for your excellent uncle's sake, it will give me
great pleasure to be of use to you.  But, Felix, my
darling, we must go and dress for the ball at Mrs
Roseapple's; we shall be late, I fear."
</p>

<p>
The tall youngster, to whose intimacy I had so
unexpectedly procured a passport, during all the time
occupied by Mr Twig in expatiating, had been
looking as grave as a judge, and making the best use of
his time.  Both now rose, and retired as it were to
dress.  Just as they had left the room, and the
master of the Ballahoo and I had filled a glass of wine
together, Mr Twig returned.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Mr Brail, I have just been thinking you
had better come with us&mdash;Mr Roseapple will be glad
to see you, I know."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I have not the honour of knowing your
friend, Mr Roseapple," said I.  "Besides, this
gentleman is the captain of the brig that I came from
Havanna in, and I invited him to supper with me;
so"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The more the merrier, man&mdash;the more the
merrier&mdash;why, <i>we shall take him too</i>."
</p>

<p>
All this appeared to me very odd, and too free-and-easy
by a great deal; but the sailor had by this time
drank more Madeira than he was accustomed to, and
as he, to my great surprise, made no objection to the
proposal, only stating that he had no clothes fit to
appear with in a ball-room, I thought I might as well
swim with the current also.
</p>

<p>
Jacob eyed him.
</p>

<p>
"Why, do you know, you are a deuced good-looking fellow."
</p>

<p>
Jack rose, and made a most awkward obeisance.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, 'pon my honour," quoth Twig, with the
utmost gravity&mdash;"so <i>my</i> clothes will suit you to a
nicety&mdash;ahem!  Cato, tell Romulus to desire
Cobbler to fetch in my portmanteau instantly.  So come
along, <i>my dear fellow</i>, and let us rig you."  (What
next, thought I&mdash;this to a man he never saw before!)  And
away the Jolly tar sculled between Mr Twig
and his friend Flamingo.
</p>

<p>
I had never before been guilty of such a heterodox
proceeding, as going unasked to a ball given by a lady
I had never seen or even heard of; and although the
wine I had drank had by this created no small
innovation in my brain, still I had discretion enough left
to induce me to go up to Mr Twig's room door, where
I again remonstrated with him on the impropriety of
such an intrusion on my part.
</p>

<p>
"Poo, nonsense, my dear fellow.  Just say you
are old Frenche's nephew, and the whole company will
hug you as an old acquaintance, man&mdash;not a Creole
miss but will set her cap at you&mdash;take Jacob Twig's
word for it&mdash;why, you will find that your fame has
outstripped you the instant your name is mentioned,
for your uncle makes no secret of his intention to
make you his heir&mdash;so come along, man.  Go
dress&mdash;that's a good fellow."
</p>

<p>
I did so, and we were presently all in the hall of
the tavern again, where friend Quacco was waiting
with my cloak and hat, ready for a start.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Quacco; I hope you have made yourself
comfortable?"
</p>

<p>
Quacco grinned.  "Very, sir; find myself great
man here.  My story please people&mdash;better country
dis dan de coast of Africa."
</p>

<p>
"Glad you find it so; but where, in heaven's name,
got you that rig? you don't mean to follow me to Mr
Roseapple's in such a dress?"
</p>

<p>
"Certainly I do, with massa's permission."  And
he snuffed the air as if his <i>amour propre</i> had been
somewhat wounded by my disapproval of the mode in
which it had pleased him to make his toilet.
</p>

<p>
"But you will be laughed at, and get me into some
ridiculous scrape."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, massa; never fear Quacco's discretion&mdash;never
fear.  I have much practice in Havanna, in wait
on gentlemen at table.  Ah, you sall see, massa&mdash;but
one ting I sall pretend, dat I is one Spanish negro;
dis will give de interest to me, you know."  (<i>Interest!</i> thought
I, like to laugh in his face.)  "So tell de
captain dere, not to peach upon Quacco&mdash;say I am
one Spanish sarvant you got from de governor Señor
Cien Fuegos."
</p>

<p>
I laughed heartily at this instance of barbarous
puppyism, and at the figure he cut when I had leisure
to look at him.  First, he had powdered his black
woolly cocoa-nut shaped skull with flour, until it was
perfectly white, the little crispy curls making it look
like a large cauliflower, or a round furze bush with a
drift of snow well grained into it.  To the short,
well-greased wool, he had attached a long slender queue abaft,
like a yard of pig-tail tobacco, that hung straight down
his back, over an old faded Spanish-cut sky-blue silk
coat, thickly studded with large sparkling cut-steel
buttons, all too short at the wrists, and too long at the
skirts; so that while the monkey-looking paws were
largely uncovered, the latter reached half-way down his
leg; a faded white satin embroidered waistcoat, the flaps
coming down over his hips; black silk small clothes, and
a pair of large old-fashioned shoes, very high in the
instep&mdash;these, with a pair of great lackered buckles,
completed his dress.  As an ultra ornament, he sported
a very flashy pink watch-ribbon, with a great bunch
of brass keys and seals, but to what substitute for a
horologe these gaudy ornaments were attached, the
deponent sayeth not.  As for his cucumber shanks,
they were naked, and unless one had been particular
in the inspection, so as to perceive the little tufts of
black wool that covered them, like a miniken forest of
fir-trees, you could not have made out whether he had
silk stockings on or not.  To perfect his equipment
and give him the true <i>finish</i>, he had acquired a little
"<i>sombrero de ires picas</i>," or old fashioned cocked
hat, an amber-headed cane, and when you add one
gold ear-ring and another of silver, an enormous silver
brooch, with a stone in it, more like a petrified
oyster than any thing else, in the breast of his gaudily
befrilled shirt, with a pair of green spectacles on his
nose, over which his low tatooed forehead fell back
like a monkey's, you have our friend Quacco before
you, as well as I can paint him.
</p>

<p>
"Mercy on me," said Mr Felix Flamingo, "<i>what
is this!</i>&mdash;who have we here?"
</p>

<p>
"My servant," said I, unable to restrain my
laughter, "strangely transmogrified certainly."
</p>

<p>
By this time Mr Twig joined us, having retired
with the skipper of the merchantman, whom he had
dressed out in a suit of his own clothes; and as he
was really a very handsome man, he looked uncommonly
well, allowing for his nautical roll and salt water
flavour, in his borrowed plumes.
</p>

<p>
"Now," said Flamingo, "we must be jogging.
So, Quacco, lead the way."
</p>

<p>
"Stop," said Jacob; "no hurry, Felix, it an't
long past ten yet, so let us crack a bottle of Sally's
champagne, it <i>launches</i> one so nobly into a ball-room;
it is the <i>grease</i> on the ways, my lads, if I may venture
on so vulgar a simile.  So, Sally&mdash;Sally, a bottle of
champagne."
</p>

<p>
The wine was brought, and was really extremely
good,&mdash;so unexpectedly good, that somehow we had
number two, just to see whether the first had been a
fair sample of the batch or no.  At length, we again
addressed ourselves for the start.
</p>

<p>
But the master of the brig, who was modest to
bashfulness in his cool moments, had become a changed
creature from the innovation wrought in his brain by
the unusual potation.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, had it been strong grog, I would have
carried sail with most of you; but really I must&mdash;I
must&mdash;in short, Mrs Sally, I must top off with some
hot brandy and water before weighing."
</p>

<p>
The hot stuff was brought, and we finally started
for Mr Roseapple's in earnest; Quacco in advance,
carrying a small stable lantern, held aloft on the end
of his cane; then Mr Felix Flamingo and I abreast,
followed by Mr Twig and the skipper.
</p>

<p>
The cool night air was an astonishing assistant
to the grog, as I could perceive, from the enunciation
of the sailor in my wake becoming rapidly thicker and
more indistinct as we advanced.
</p>

<p>
The street we passed through was quite still, the
inhabitants, according to the custom of the country,
having already retired to rest; but several gigs, and
carriages of various descriptions, gritted past us,
through the deep sand of the unpaved thoroughfares,
apparently returning from setting down company.
</p>

<p>
As we were toiling up the hill, crowned with the
gay domicile, which was sparkling with lights, and
resounding with music, and merry voices, and laughter,
we could, through the open blinds, see dark figures
flitting and moving rapidly about between us and the
lamps.
</p>

<p>
"Felix," quoth Mr Twig&mdash;"how vastly gay&mdash;stop,
let us reconnoitre a bit"&mdash;and we, all hove to in the
middle of the ascent, when, without any warning,
down came a plump of rain like a waterspout, the
effect of which was instantly to set us a scampering as
fast as our legs could carry us, preceded by Serjeant
Quacco with the lantern, who hopped and jumped
about from stone to stone, like an <i>ignis fatuus</i>; nor
did we stop in our red-hot haste until we had all bolted
up the steps, and into the piazza, where the dancing
was going on, to the dismay and great discomfiture of
the performers; indeed, so great was the impetus with
which we charged that we fairly broke the line, and
did not bring up until we had reached the inner hall
or saloon, where several couples were drinking coffee,
and taking other refreshments, at a side-board or long
table, behind which stood several male and female
domestics&mdash;blacks and browns&mdash;ladling out punch, and
negus, and fruits, and handing sandwiches and coffee,
and all manner of Creole luxuries.
</p>

<p>
We were immediately introduced to mine host and
his lady, both remarkably pleasant people, who, with
true West India cordiality, made all manner of
allowance for the suddenness of our <i>entrée</i>, and the
unexpectedness of our visit altogether.  So here we were
brought up all standing, as suddenly as if we had
dropped from the moon.
</p>

<p>
There had been a pause in the dancing, created by
our furious onset, as well there might, and now a
general titter, gradually swelling into an universal
laugh, ran round, and the dance broke up into a general
promenade of the whole company; during which,
taking Mr Flamingo's offered arm, I had not only
time to recover my equanimity, but an opportunity of
looking about me and making my observations.
</p>

<p>
The house was a very large airy pavilion, erected
on a small limestone bluff, that overhung the sea at
the easternmost point of the bay.  According to the
Jamaica fashion, it consisted of a brick shell two
stories high, subdivided into the various apartments,
public and private, composing the domicile.  The first
floor, comprising a very handsome dining-room, and
a most elegant suite of lofty drawing-rooms, beautifully
papered, and magnificently furnished, was raised
on a stone pediment about eight feet high (containing
cellars and other offices); and above this,
I presume, the bed-rooms of the family were situated.
</p>

<p>
The whole of the surbazes and wooden work about
the windows and doors were of well-polished and
solid mahogany, of the most costly description.  These
rooms were all fitted with glass sashes, that opened
into the piazzas&mdash;long galleries, about fourteen feet
wide, that enclosed the whole house; with white
pillars and green blinds, fitted between them like
those of a tanwork, but smaller, which, when open,
with the feather edges of the blades towards you, as
you looked at the fabric from a distance, gave it the
appearance of a Brobdingnag bird-cage; and indeed,
so far as the complexion of the majority of the male
figurantes on the present occasion went, it might be
said to be well filled with canaries.
</p>

<p>
The roof was composed of what are called <i>shingles</i>
in the United States&mdash;pieces of cypress splinters,
about eighteen inches long by four broad, and half an
inch thick, which are nailed on, overlapping like slates;
indeed, when weatherstained, at a distance you cannot
distinguish the difference, excepting as in the present
case, when they are covered with brown paint to
preserve them.
</p>

<p>
From this peculiarity in the covering of the roof of
a West Indian house, it often happens, when the rains
set in suddenly after a long drought, that the water
finds its way down, in consequence of the warping of
the wood, in rather uncomfortable quantities;
insomuch, that when you go to bed, the rooms in the
houses in the country being often unceiled, an
umbrella may be as necessary as a nightcap.  However,
after the <i>seasons</i>, as they are called, have continued a
few days, the cypress or cedar swells, and a very
indifferent roof becomes perfectly water tight.
</p>

<p>
To return.  No sooner did the shower abate, than
a whole crowd of negroes, male and female, once more
clustered round the door, and scrambled up on the trees
round the house, to get a peep at the company through
the open windows and blinds.
</p>

<p>
"Do you admire our West India fruits, Mr Brail?"
quoth Twig, cocking his eye at the blackies aloft.
</p>

<p>
I was exceedingly struck by the profuse and tasteful
display of flowers and green branches with which
the rooms were decorated; many of the latter loaded
with the most luxuriant bunches and clusters of
fruits&mdash;oranges, star-apples, citrons, and a whole array of
others, which as yet were nameless luxuries to me.
</p>

<p>
There was a golden pine-apple on a silver salver, on
a side-table, eighteen inches high, by nine in diameter,
that absolutely saturated the whole air of the room
with perfume.
</p>

<p>
The novelty and elegant effect of the carpetless, but
highly polished, mahogany floors, which at the sides
of the room, where not dimmed by the feet of the
dancers, reflected every thing so mirror-like, was very
striking, although at first I was in terror at the
shortness of the ladies' petticoats, and the reflection of the
brilliant chandeliers.  The dresses of the fair dames,
although they might have been a little behind the
London fashions of the day, were quite up to what
those were when I left home, except in the instances
of several natural curiosities from the inland and
mountain settlements, who were distinguished by their
rather antediluvian equipment and sleepy Creole
drawl; but as a counterpoise to both, they had the
glow of the rose of Lancaster in their cheeks.
</p>

<p>
As for the other fair creatures resident in the hot
plains in the neighbourhood of the sea, and in the still
hotter towns of the island, they were to a man
(<i>woman</i>&mdash;oh, for Kilkenny!) so deadly pale, that when
one contemplated their full, but beautiful and
exquisitely managed figures, you were struck with
amazement at the incongruity, if I may so speak, of their
sickly complexions, and sylphlike and most agile
forms.&mdash;"So these faded lilies are really in good health
after all."  Between the fair mountaineers and
lowlanders, since I have spoken of the <i>roses</i>, it might
indeed be said, that there still existed the emulation of
the two houses of York and Lancaster.  As to figure,
they were both exquisite&mdash;Lancaster, however, more
full of health, more European looking in complexion,
and a good deal more hoydenish in manner&mdash;York more
languid and sentimental, to appearance at least.
</p>

<p>
But the men&mdash;"Oh, massa neger!" to borrow
from Quashie&mdash;what a sallow cadaverous crew! with
the exception of an officer or two from the neighbouring
garrison, and one or two young chaps lately
imported&mdash;what rigs!&mdash;such curious cut coats&mdash;some
with the waists indicated by two little twin buttons
between the shoulders, and scarcely any collar, with
the long tapering skirts flapping against the calves of
their legs, in shape like the feathers in the tail of a
bird of Paradise&mdash;others with the aforesaid landmarks,
or waist-buttons, of the size and appearance of
crown-pieces, covered with verdegris, and situated over
against the hip-joints, and half a yard asunder, while
the capes stood up stiff and high, and the square-cut
skirts that depended beneath (perfect antitheses to the
former) were so very short and concise, that they ended
as abruptly as a hungry judge's summing up.  However,
no fault could be found with the average manners of
the whole party, whatever might have been objected
to their equipment.
</p>

<p>
I soon noticed that the effects of our soaking were
giving great entertainment to the company, for the
heat of the apartments forced clouds of vapour from
our wet coats, as we kept cruising about like so many
smoking haycocks carried away by a flood.  We could
have been traced from room to room by the clouds we
sent up, and the oily steam of the wool.
</p>

<p>
About the time supper was announced, which was
tastefully laid out in the piazza, and just before the
guzzle began, I was drawn towards the inner hall,
along with my fair partner, by a general titter, as if
something amusing had been going on.  Just as we
approached, however, the door connecting the two
apartments was shut, in consequence of some preparation
for supper, so that the hall where the company
were now collected was rather awkwardly entered by a
side-door from a sort of second drawingroom communicating
with the principal saloon&mdash;to the left, and
directly opposite to the side entrance, there was a large
mirror reaching to the floor.  The shutting of the door
before mentioned, had thus the effect of altering the
geography of the interior apartment very materially,
to one who had been the whole evening passing and
repassing, straight as an arrow, through it from the
dancingroom to the piazza.
</p>

<p>
The change was especially unfortunate for poor
Hause, the master of the brig, who was by this time
pretty well slewed; for, as he entered by the
side-door, with the recollection of another that should
have been right a-head facing him, and opening into
the piazza, he made directly for the large mirror that
now fronted him, and beyond all question he would
have walked right through it, just as we entered, had
it not been guarded by brass rods, or fenders, having,
according to the old jest, mistaken it for the doorway.
After the fenders brought him up, still he was not
undeceived, but for a minute showed his breeding by
dancing from one side to another, and bowing and
scraping in a vain attempt to get past his own shadow.
At length he found out his mistake; but no way
abashed, his laugh was the loudest in the throng,
exclaiming, "Why, we must have the channel
buoyed, Mr Brail.  I thought the landmarks had
been changed by witchcraft, and no wonder, seeing
we are surrounded by enchantresses;" and here he
made the most laughable wallop imaginable, intended
for a bow, but more like the gambol of a porpoise.
"However, Miss &mdash;&mdash;, you see there are moorings
laid down for us there in the piazza, so let us bear
up and run for them through the other channel,
before those lubberly fellows haul them on board;"
and so saying, he hove ahead, with a fair scion of the
aforesaid House of Lancaster in tow, until they came
to where our friend Quacco was the busiest of the
busy, having literally bustled the other blackies out
of all countenance, and whom, as we entered, he was
roundly abusing in Spanish for lazy "<i>pendejos</i>" and
"<i>picarons</i>," as if he had been the master of the
house, or major domo at the least&mdash;enforcing his
commands with a crack over the skull every now and
then, from a silver ladle that he carried in his hand
as a symbol of authority.
</p>

<p>
At length the vagaries of our friend, as he waxed
drunk, became too noticeable, and the master of the
house asked the gentleman who was nearest him,
whose servant he was, the party I could see
indicated me, and I was about apologizing, when some
thing or other diverted the attention of our landlord
from the subject, and the black Serjeant escaped
farther notice.  I had before this observed a very
handsome, tall, well-made man in the party, whose face
somehow or other I fancied I had seen before, with
an air peculiarly <i>distingué</i>, who, so far as I could
judge, was a stranger to most of the visitors.  He
had been introduced by the landlord to one or two of
the ladies, and for some time seemed to devote
himself entirely to his partners, and certainly he was
making himself abundantly agreeable, to judge from
appearances.  At length he took occasion to steal
away from the side of the table he was on, and
crossed in rather a marked manner to the other,
where poor Hause, now three sheets in the wind, was
sitting, doing the agreeable as genteely as a
Norwegian bear, or a walrus, and planting himself beside
him, he seemed to be endeavouring to draw him into
conversation; but the skipper was too devoted an
admirer of the ladies to be bothered with males, at
that time at least, so the stranger appeared to fail in
his attempts to engage his attention.  However, he
persisted, and as I passed near them I could hear him
ask, "if his sails were unbent, and whether he was
anchored by a chain or a hempen cable?"
</p>

<p>
"And pray," hiccuped Hause, whose heart wine had
opened, "don't you know I only got in last night, so
how the deuce could I have unbent any thing&mdash;and
my chain cable is left to be repaired at Havanna, since
you must know; but do you think it's coming on to
blow, friend, that you seem so anxious to know about
my ground tackle? or should I keep my sails bent,
to be ready to slip, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"In '<i>vino veritas</i>,'" thought I; "but why so
communicative, Master Hause?"  I could not hear
the stranger's reply, but I noticed that he rose at this,
and dispersed among the congregating dancers in the
other room.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Mr Jones," at this juncture, said our
landlord to the gentleman already mentioned, as sitting
nearest him, "what is the gentleman's name that
Turner brought with him?"
</p>

<p>
"Wilson, I think, he called him," said the party
addressed.  "He arrived yesterday morning at
Falmouth, in some vessel consigned to Turner from the
coast of Cuba, and I believe is bound to Kingston."
</p>

<p>
"He is a very handsome, well-bred fellow, whoever
he may be, and I should like to know more of him,"
rejoined our host.  "But, come, gentlemen, the ladies
are glancing over their shoulders; they seem to think
we are wasting time here, so what say you?"
</p>

<p>
This was the signal for all of us to rise, and here
we had a second edition of the comical blunders of
poor Captain Hause.  On his return from the supper-table
to the drawingroom, he was waylaid by Flamingo,
and having a sort of muzzy recollection of his
previous mistake, he set himself with drunken gravity to
take an observation, as he said, in order to work his
position on the chart more correctly this time.  But the
champagne he had swilled had increased his conglomeration
twofold, which Master Felix perceiving, he took
an opportunity of treating him to several spinning
turns round the inner room, until he lost himself and
his latitude entirely.  He then let the bewildered sailor
go, and the first thing he did was <i>this time</i> to mistake
the <i>real</i> door, now open into the dancingroom, for the
<i>mirror</i>; thus reversing his former blunder; and
although Twig, who was standing in the other room,
good naturedly beckoned him to advance, he stood
rooted to the spot, as if an invisible barrier
prevented his ingress.  And when the young lady he had
been dancing with would have led him in, he drew
back like a rabid dog at water&mdash;"Avast, miss,
avast&mdash;too old a cruiser to be taken in twice that
way&mdash;shan't walk through a looking-glass, even to oblige you,
miss&mdash;no, no&mdash;Bill Hause knows better.  Here&mdash;here&mdash;this
way&mdash;that's the door on your starboard beam&mdash;and
the mirror&mdash;bless you, that's the mirror right
a-head," and so saying, he dragged the laughing girl
away from the door up to the glass once more.
</p>

<p>
"What a deuced handsome fellow that chap under
bare poles is, miss."&mdash;This was himself, dressed in Mr
Twig's small clothes and black silk stockings&mdash;"I
should be sorry to trust <i>my</i> lower spars out of
trowsers, however, I know."
</p>

<p>
There was no standing all this, especially as
Flamingo followed him close, and standing behind him, a
little to one side&mdash;on his starboard quarter as he
himself would have said&mdash;made signs to him in the glass
to advance, on which the sailor made a tipsy bolt of it,
and was a second time brought up by the brass rods&mdash;nor
was he convinced of his mistake until he felt the
cold surface of the plate glass with his great paw.
Twig now kindly interfered and got the poor skipper
away, and bestowed on a sofa, and dancing recommenced
with redoubled energy.  The fiddlers scraped with
all their might, the man who played the octave flute
whistled like a curlew, and the tabor was fiercely
beaten, rumpti, tumpti, while the black ballet-master
sung out sharp and shrill his mongrel French directions,
his <i>chassées</i> and his <i>balancées</i> to massa dis, and
misses dat, indicating the parties by name; who
thereupon pricked up their ears, and looking as grave as
judges, pointed their toes, and did, or attempted to do,
as they were bid.  But, as I was overheated, I strolled
into the piazza fronting the sea, where the lights by
this time had either burned out, or had been removed&mdash;it
was very dark.  I walked to the corner farthest
from the noise of the dancers, and peered through the
open <i>jealousies</i>, or blinds, on the scene below.
</p>

<p>
The moon was in the second quarter, and by this
time within an hour of her setting.  She cast a long
trembling wake of faint greenish light on the quiet
harbour below, across which the land wind would
occasionally shoot in catspaws, dimming and darkening
the shining surface (as if from the winnowing of the
wings of passing spirits of the air), until they died
away again, leaving their whereabouts indicated by
streaks of tiny ripples, sparkling like diamonds in
the moonbeams.  Clear of the bay, but in shore, the
water continued as smooth as glass, although out at
sea there seemed to be a light air still, the last faint
breathings of the dying sea-breeze.  The heavy clouds
that had emptied themselves on our devoted heads in
the early part of the night, had by this time settled
down in a black, wool-fringed bank in the west, the
fleecy margin of which the moon had gloriously lit up,
and was fast approaching.  The stars overhead, as the
lovely planet verged towards her setting, sparkled with
more intense brightness in the deep blue firmament;
more profoundly dark and pure, one would have thought,
from the heavy squalls we had recently had.
</p>

<p>
There was only another person in the piazza beside
myself, and he was looking steadily out on the ocean.
He was about ten yards from me, and in the obscurity
I could not well distinguish his figure.
</p>

<p>
I looked also to seaward; a large vessel was standing
in for the land, her white sails, as she glided down
towards us, drifting along the calm, gently heaving
swell of the smooth water, like a white wreath of
mist.  To leeward of her about a mile, and further
in the offing, two black specks were visible, which first
neared each other, and then receded; one standing out
to sea, and the other in for the land, as if they had
been two small vessels beating up, and crossing and
recrossing on opposite tacks, between us and the moon.
If it had been war time, I would have said they were
manoeuvring to cut off the ship; but as it was, I
thought nothing of it.  Presently the vessel approaching,
fired a gun, and hoisted a light, which I presumed
to be the signal for a pilot, on which two boats shoved
out towards her from under the land.  I watched them
till they got alongside, when I heard a loud startled
shout, and then voices, as if in alarm, and the sound of
a scuffle, during which several musket or pistol shots
went off&mdash;next minute all was quiet again, but the
yards and sails of the ship were immediately braced
round, as she hauled by the wind, and stood off the land.
</p>

<p>
"Curse the blockhead, why does he meddle with
<i>her</i>?" said a voice near me.
</p>

<p>
I started&mdash;it could only have been the solitary
person I had formerly noticed.  As I turned, one of the
lozenges of blinds fell down, and opened with a rattle
that made me start, and disturbed him.
</p>

<p>
"What does the ship mean by manoeuvring in that
incomprehensible way?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Really can't tell, sir," said the person addressed,
evidently surprised at my vicinity&mdash;"I suppose she
has been disappointed in getting a pilot, and intends
to lie off and on till daylight."
</p>

<p>
"But what could the noise of scuffling be?  Didn't
you hear it?" I continued,&mdash;"and the pistol shots?"
</p>

<p>
"Pistol shots!  No.  I heard no pistol shots," quoth
he, drily.
</p>

<p>
"The devil you didn't&mdash;then you must have been
deaf," thought I; and as he turned to rejoin the
dancers, I made him out, the moment he came into the
light, to be the stranger indicated in the conversation
between the landlord and his guest at supper.
</p>

<p>
"Very odd all this," quoth I; and I should say,
were he a suspicious character, that it was very
shallow in this chap to let such an exclamation escape
him; and I again looked earnestly at him.  "Ah!
I see, he has been drinking wine, like our friend the
skipper."
</p>

<p>
I joined our host, but still I could not avoid again
asking him who the deuce this same stranger was?
</p>

<p>
"I really cannot tell you, Mr Brail.  He is a very
well-bred man&mdash;you see <i>that</i> yourself,&mdash;but there is
something uncommon about him, unquestionably.  All
the women are dying to know who he is, he dances so
well."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, and talks so bewitchingly," quoth my lady-hostess&mdash;no
less a person,&mdash;as she passed close to us,
hanging on the very individual's arm.
</p>

<p>
"Heyday!  It's my turn now&mdash;so!  Confound the
fellow, who <i>can</i> he be?" said my host, laughing.
</p>

<p>
"That strange gentleman <i>has such</i> a beautiful tone
of voice, uncle," said a little lady&mdash;his niece, I
believe,&mdash;who during our colloquy had taken hold of Mr
Roseapple's hand.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, Miss Tomboy!&mdash;Why, there again, Mr
Brail.  Young and old, male and female&mdash;he seems to
have fascinated all of them.&mdash;But I really cannot give
you more information regarding him, than that my
friend Turner brought him up in his gig from
Falmouth, and sent to ask leave if he might bring him to
the party.  It seems he came over two days ago from
the opposite coast of Cuba, in a felucca, with live
stock and dye woods,"&mdash;I started at this&mdash;"or
something equally ungenteel, which he consigned to Turner;
and, having got the value of them in advance, he is on
his way to Kingston.  He says that the cargo was
merely to pay his expenses, and seemed desirous of
insinuating, I thought, that accident alone had been
the cause of his being led to deal in such vulgar
articles as Spanish bullocks and Nicaragua wood."
</p>

<p>
"I verily believe him," said I.
</p>

<p>
"He does seem a high sort of fellow," continued
Mr Roseapple, without noticing my interruption.
"But here is Turner, let us ask him.&mdash;I say, Turner,
allow me to introduce Mr Brail to you."
</p>

<p>
We bowed to each other.
</p>

<p>
"We have been speaking about your friend."
</p>

<p>
"Well," said Turner, "I believe, Roseapple, you
know about as much of him as I do."
</p>

<p>
"Pray," said I, "may I ask what sort of craft this
same felucca was?"
</p>

<p>
<i>The Falmouth gentleman described the Midge exactly</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Well," thought I, "the vessel <i>may</i> be owned by
an honest man after all; at any rate, what does it
signify to me whether she be or no?"  Nevertheless, I
had an itching to know more about her somehow.
</p>

<p>
"Is the felucca still at Falmouth, sir, may I ask?"
continued I.
</p>

<p>
"No; she sailed yesterday morning at daylight."
</p>

<p>
"That was something of the suddenest too," said I.
</p>

<p>
"We gave her every expedition, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt it&mdash;I don't doubt it&mdash;Was there a
schooner in company, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No; no schooner&mdash;&mdash;But there is my partner
waiting for me, so you'll excuse me, Mr Brail."  So
saying, away skipped Mr Turner, and I had no other
opportunity of asking him any more questions.
</p>

<p>
As I had nothing particular to engage me among
the dancers, I again strolled into the dark piazza.  Mr
Roseapple followed me.
</p>

<p>
"Why, you seem strangely given to the darkness,
Mr Brail; it cannot be because your deeds are evil;
won't you join the dancers?"
</p>

<p>
"I will presently, sir," said I laughing; "but
really I have a great curiosity to know what that ship
is about out there.  Is there any vessel expected from
England, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, a great many.  The Tom Bowline from London
has been becalmed in the offing the whole day; I
saw her from the piazza some time ago.  I fear she
will not get in until the sea-breeze sets down to
morrow.  There," said he, pointing at the lessening
vessel, "look! she has stood out to sea yonder.  She
intends giving the land a good berth until daylight, I
suppose."
</p>

<p>
"She does do that thing," thought I.&mdash;"Pray, Mr
Roseapple, do you happen to know whether she took
a pilot during the daylight?"
</p>

<p>
"To be sure she did&mdash;she is consigned to me.  The
pilot-canoe brought my English letters ashore."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed!" said I; "then what boats could those
be that boarded her a little while ago?  Besides, I heard
pistol shots, and a sound as of struggling."
</p>

<p>
"Oh," quoth mine host, "the captain is a gay chap,
and has a great many friends here, who are generally
on the look-out to board him in the offing.  Besides,
he is always burning lights, and blazing away."
</p>

<p>
"Very well," thought I, "it's all one to me."
</p>

<p>
I now noticed that the ship, having got into the
sea-breeze, had bore up again, and was running down
towards the two small vessels to leeward.  As she ran
off the wind, and got between us and the moon, her
sails no longer reflected the light, but became dark and
cloudlike; when she reached them, they all stood out
to sea, and gradually disappeared in the misty distance
like dusky specks.  Not wishing to appear an alarmist,
I made no farther remark.
</p>

<p>
As Mr Roseapple and I walked back into the room,
the first thing that struck us was the master of the
Ballahoo sound asleep on a sofa, and Mr Flamingo
carefully strewing the great rough seaman with roses
and jessamine leaves.
</p>

<p>
"Love amongst the roses," quoth he, as he joined
his partner.
</p>

<p>
"I see that same stranger, who has been puzzling
us all, has succeeded in making that poor fellow
helplessly drunk," said Jacob Twig.
</p>

<p>
"Bad luck to him!" quoth I.
</p>

<p>
It appeared, that he had been much with him during
the evening; and had been overheard making many
minute enquiries regarding the tonnage of his
vessel&mdash;the number of hands on board&mdash;and as to whether
the Spaniards and their money had been landed or
not; but as both were strangers, and the unknown
had apparently a smattering of nautical knowledge, it
seemed natural enough that they should draw up
together, and no one seemed to think any thing of it.
</p>

<p>
It was now three o'clock in the morning, and high
time to bid our worthy host adieu; so, after I had
again apologized for my intrusion, Mr Twig, Flamingo,
Captain Hause, and myself, withdrew, and took
the road homewards to our quarters in the town.
</p>

<p>
Mr Jacob was leading the way as steady as a judge,
for he seemed quite sober, so far as his locomotion
was concerned; but Flamingo and I, who, I grieve to
say it, were not quite the thing ourselves, had the
greatest difficulty in lugging the skipper of the brig
along with us; for, on the principle that the blind
should lead the blind, Twig had coolly enough left him
to our care, Bacchus had fairly conquered Neptune.
</p>

<p>
Whilst we were staggering along, under the
influence of the rosy god and the weight of the skipper,
who should spring past, in a fast run, apparently in
red-hot haste, but the mysterious Mr Wilson!
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, my fine fellow," quoth Twig, "whither so
swiftly?  Slacken your pace, man, and be
compani-o-n-a-ble."
</p>

<p>
I now perceived that Twig's legs were the discreetest
of his members, and more to be relied on than his
tongue; his potations having considerably interfered
with his usually clear enunciation.  The person hailed
neither shortened sail nor answered him.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mr Twig," shouted I, "if you don't heave
to, we must cast off Mr Hause here.  I believe he is
in an apoplexy, he is so deadly heavy."
</p>

<p>
"Here, Mr Brail&mdash;here&mdash;bring him along," quoth
Twig, returning from the front, and laying hold of
the navigator wheelbarrow fashion, placing himself
between his legs, while Flamingo and I had each a
hold of an arm.  As for the head, we left it to take
care of itself, as it bumped on the hard path at every
step, demolishing, no doubt, thousands of sand-flies at
every lollop.  We staggered down the zigzag road,
until we came to an opening in the lime fence, through
which we turned sharp off into the fields, led by Massa
Twig.  Here, wading through wet guinea-grass up to
our hip-joints, which drenched us in a moment to the
skin, we arrived at a small rocky knoll under an
orange-tree, where we deposited the drunk man on his
back, and then, with all the tipsy gravity in the world,
sat ourselves down beside him.
</p>

<p>
We were now planted on a limestone pinnacle of
the bluff, on which the house stood, from the fissures
of which grew a most superb orange-tree that
overshadowed us.  Our perch commanded a view to
seaward, as well as of the harbour, that slept under our
feet in the moonlight.  As soon as we came to an
anchor, Flamingo ascended the tree, which was loaded
with golden fruit, and sparkling with fireflies.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing like an orange with the dew on it,"
quoth he, stretching to reach a bunch, when he missed
his footing, and shook down a whole volley of oranges,
and a shower of heavy dew.
</p>

<p>
"Confound you, Felix," quoth Jacob Twig, who
received a copious showerbath in his neck, as he
stooped his head, busying himself in an unavailing
attempt to strike fire with his pocket-flint and steel,
in order to light his cigar, "what do you mean by
that?"
</p>

<p>
"A volley of grapeshot from the felucca," stuttered
the skipper, on whose face Flamingo had again
dropped a whole hatful of fruit, sending down along with
them another fall of diamonds.
</p>

<p>
"Now, don't be so pluviose, Flamingo," again sung
out Twig; "come down out of that tree, Felix, or I'll
shy this stone at you, as I am a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"An't I a very pretty peacock, Jacob?" quoth
his troublesome friend.  "But stop, I <i>will</i> come
down"&mdash;seeing Twig preparing to make his threat
good&mdash;"so keep your temper, man, and haul Tarrybreeks
nearer the root of the tree, that I may fall soft."
</p>

<p>
"I say, Flamingo," quoth Twig, "you don't mean to
make a featherbed of the navigator's carcass, do you?"
</p>

<p>
Crash at this moment went the bough on which our
friend had trusted himself, and down he came, tearing
his way through the strong thorns of the tree, right
upon us.  However, his fall was so much broken by
the other branches, that there was no great harm done,
if we except the scratches that he himself received,
and a rent or two in his clothes.
</p>

<p>
"Murder, how I am scratched and torn, to be sure&mdash;why,
see, my clothes are all in tatters absolutely,"
with a long drawl.
</p>

<p>
"Serve you right, you troublesome animal," quoth
Twig; "but sit down, and be quiet if you can.
Look, have you no poetry in you, Felix?  Is not that
scene worth looking at?"
</p>

<p>
The black bank of clouds that had slid down the
western sky, and had floated for some time above the
horizon, now sank behind the hills, above whose dark
outline the setting moon was lingering.
</p>

<p>
The pale clear luminary still cast a long stream of
light on the quiet waters of the bay, which were
crisping and twinkling in the land-breeze; and the
wet roofs of the houses of the town beneath, whose
dark masses threw their long shadows towards us,
glanced in her departing beams like sheets of polished
silver.  The grass and bushes beside us were sparkling
with dewdrops, and spangled with fireflies.  The
black silent hulls of the vessels at anchor floated
motionless on the bosom of the calm waters; the
Ballahoo being conspicuous from her low hull and tall
spars.  The lantern that had been hoisted to guide
the skipper on his return still burned like a small red
spark at the gaff end.
</p>

<p>
There were one or two lights sparkling and disappearing
in the lattices of the houses on the bay, as if
the inmates were already bestirring themselves, early
as it was.
</p>

<p>
The moon was just disappearing, when a canoe,
pulling four oars, with one solitary figure in the stern,
dashed across her wake, and pushed out to sea.
</p>

<p>
We distinctly heard the hollow voices of the men,
and the rumble of the rollocks, and the cheeping and
splashing of the broad bladed paddles.  I looked with
all my eyes.  "A doubloon, if you pull to please
me," said a voice distinctly from the boat.
</p>

<p>
"That chap must be in a deuced hurry, whoever
he may be," quoth Jacob Twig.
</p>

<p>
"It's more than you seem to be, my boy," rejoined
Master Felix, "You seem to be inclined to sit here
all night; so I'll e'en stump along to my lodgings, at
Sally Frenche's, and leave you and the skipper <i>al
fresco</i> here, to rise when it pleases you.  Come, Mr
Brail, will you go, or shall I send you out a nightcap
and a boat-cloak?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh we shall all go together," said I; "only let
us take another look at that most beautiful sky."
</p>

<p>
The moon had now disappeared behind the distant
mountains, leaving their dark outlines sharply cut out
against the clear greenish light of the western sky.
They looked like the shore to some mysteriously
transparent, self-luminous, but deadly calm ocean.
Several shreds of vapour floated in this mild radiance,
like small icebergs in the north sea, during the long
twilight night, while the sun is circling round just
below the horizon; while to windward[<a id="chap06fn2text"></a><a href="#chap06fn2">2</a>] the fast
reddening sky, and the rise of the morning star, gave
token of the near approach of day.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap06fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap06fn2text">2</a>] Once for all.  In the West Indies, from the sea-breeze, or
trade-winds, always blowing from the east, objects or places are
universally indicated, even during a temporary calm, as being
situated <i>to windward</i> or <i>to leeward</i>,
according as they are to the
<i>eastward</i> or <i>westward</i> of the speaker.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We got home, and tumbled into bed, and it was
two o'clock in the afternoon before I rose to breakfast.
</p>

<p>
The sea-breeze was by this time blowing strong,
almost half a gale of wind, making the shingles of the
roof clatter like watchmen's rattles, and whistling
through the house like a tornado.
</p>

<p>
I had just risen, and taken my razors out of my
desk, which lay open on the dressing-table, when the
wooden-blinds of the window fell down with a loud
bang, from the dropping out of the pin that held them
shut, and away went the letters and papers it
contained, scattered by the reckless breeze east, west,
north, and south; some flying up to the roof, others
sticking against the walls far above my ken, as
resolutely as if they had been pasted on by little
Waddington the billsticker himself; while, by a sort of
eddy wind, several were whisked away out of the door
(that at the moment was opened by a negro boy with
my coat in one hand, a beautiful pine-apple on a
plate in the other, and a tin shaving-jug <i>full of boiling
water on his head</i>), and disappeared amongst the
branches of a large umbrageous kennip-tree, that
overshadowed the back-yard, to be worked up in due
time into bird's nests.
</p>

<p>
"There they go," cried I.  "Why,&mdash;Sally, cousin
Sally!"&mdash;she was bustling about her domestic
matters&mdash;"see all my letters flying about the yard there;
send some of the small fry to catch them."
</p>

<p>
I continued my shaving, until another puff whipped
up the piece of paper I had been wiping my razor on,
charged as it was with soap-suds, and there it ascended
spirally in a tiny whirlwind, until it reached the roof,
where, thinking it would stick to the rafters, after
being tired of its gyrations, the room being unceiled,
I shouted to Sally to bring me one of the vagrant
papers to supply its place; but, as I peeped through
the blinds to observe how she came on, I felt
something settle down as gently as a snow-flake on the
crown of my head.  "Do try and secure my <i>love</i>-letters,
cousin."
</p>

<p>
"Love-letter, dem?" quoth Sally, jumping up at
the words, "La, Massa Benjamin, how you no say so
before&mdash;love-letter&mdash;I tink dem was no more as
shaving-paper."
</p>

<p>
"Shaving-paper?  Oh no, all my shaving-paper is
sticking to the crown of my head, Sally; see here,"
stooping down to show her the patch on my skull.
</p>

<p>
Sally was now all energy.  "Shomp, Teemoty,
Peeta, up de tree, you willains, and fetch me all dese
piece of paper, dem&mdash;shomp;" and the fugitive pieces
were soon secured.
</p>

<p>
When Sally, honest lady, entered with the papers,
the soapy scalp still adhered to my caput.  She first
looked in my face, being a sort of quiz in her way,
and then at it.  "Dat is new fashion, Massa
Benjamin.  When gentlemen shave demself in England
now-a-day, do dey wipe de razor on crone of dem
head?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly they do," said I; "the universal custom,
Sally, every man or woman, <i>willy nilly</i>, must
wipe their razors, henceforth and for ever, on pieces of
paper stuck on the crown of their heads.  There is an
act of Parliament for it."
</p>

<p>
"My gracious!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, you may say that,"
</p>

<p>
And exit Sally Frenche to her household cares once
more.
</p>

<p>
I had now time to give a little attention to the
scenery of the yard, where Cousin Sally reigned
supreme.
</p>

<p>
Three sides of the square (the house composing the
fourth) were occupied by ranges of low wooden huts,
containing kitchen and washing-houses, rooms for the
domestic negroes, and a long open shed, fronting my
window, for a stable.  There was a draw-well in the
centre, round which numberless fowls, turkeys, geese,
ducks, guinea-birds, and pigeons, <i>flaffed</i>, and gobbled,
and quacked; while several pigs were grunting and
squeaking about the cookroom door, from whence a
black hand, armed with an iron ladle, protruded every
now and then, to give grumphy, when too intrusive,
a good crack over the skull.
</p>

<p>
Below the large kennip-tree already mentioned, sat
Sally Frenche, enthroned in state, in a low wicker
chair, with a small table beside her, on which lay an
instrument of punishment, ycleped a cowskin, a long
twisted thong of leather, with a short lash of whipcord
at the end of it.  She was nothing loth, I saw, to
apply this to the shoulders of her handmaidens when
they appeared behind hand, or sluggish in their
obedience; and even the free brownies of her household
were not always exempt from a taste thereof.
</p>

<p>
Two nice showily-dressed negresses were speaking
to her.  They each balanced a large wooden bowl on
their heads, full of handkerchiefs, gown-pieces, and
beads, and appeared to be taking their instructions as
to the prices they were to ask during the day's sale.
They departed&mdash;when a black fellow, naked all to his
trowsers, with a long clear knife in his hand,
approached, and also took some orders that I could not
hear, but apparently they had been the death-warrant
of a poor little pig, which he immediately clapper-clawed;
and, like a spider bolting with a fly, disappeared
with it, squeaking like fury, into his den&mdash;the
kitchen.
</p>

<p>
There were several little naked negro children
running about Mrs Sally, but the objects of her immediate
attention were a brown male child, of about eight years
old, and two little mulatto girls, a year or two his
seniors apparently.  The children had their primers
in their hands, and Sally held an open book in one of
hers.
</p>

<p>
The girls appeared, with the aptness of their sex,
to have said their lessons to her satisfaction, but the
little cock-yellowhammer seemed a dull concern; and
as I looked, she gave him a smart switch over his
broadest end with her cowskin.
</p>

<p>
"Try again, you stupid <i>black</i>-head"&mdash;(his head
was black enough certainly)&mdash;"now mind&mdash;what doz
you do wid your eyes?"
</p>

<p>
"I sees wid dem."
</p>

<p>
"You is right for one time&mdash;what doz you do wid
your yees?"&mdash;(ears.)
</p>

<p>
"I hears wid dem."
</p>

<p>
"Bery well&mdash;you sees you is not so stupid when
you attends&mdash;you only lazy&mdash;so now&mdash;what doz you
do wid your foots?"
</p>

<p>
"Walks wid dem."
</p>

<p>
"Bery well, indeed&mdash;now mind again&mdash;what doz
you do wid your nose?"
</p>

<p>
This was a puzzler apparently&mdash;the poor little
yellowhammer scratched his head, and eke his behind,
and looked into the tree, and all manner of ways, when
seeing Mammy Sally's fingers creeping along the table
towards the cowskin,&mdash;he rapped out,
</p>

<p>
"I <i>picks</i> him."
</p>

<p>
"<i>Picks</i> him, sir!&mdash;<i>picks</i> him!"&mdash;shouted Sally
threatening him.
</p>

<p>
"No"&mdash;blubbered the poor boy&mdash;"no, mammy&mdash;no,
I <i>blows</i> him sometimes."
</p>

<p>
"You nassy snattary little willain&mdash;what is dat you
say&mdash;you <i>smells</i> wid him, sir&mdash;you <i>smells</i> wid
him."  Another whack across his nether end, and a yell from
yellowhammer.&mdash;"Now, sir, what you doz wid your
mout?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Nyam plawn</i>."[<a id="chap06fn3text"></a><a href="#chap06fn3">3</a>]

him no hab de wrong side of de book turn up&mdash;ah
ha&mdash;massa&mdash;you don't know de difference between
de tap from de battam of de book yet?&mdash;Let me see if
I can find out de difference between, for you own tap
and battam."
</p>

<p>
Whack, whack, whack&mdash;and away ran the poor little
fellow, followed by the two girls, so contagious was
his fear; and off started the wrathful Sally after them,
through the flock of living creatures; until she
stumbled and fell over a stout porker; on which a
turkey-cock, taking the intrusion in bad part, began stoutly
to dig at Sally's face with his heels, and peck at her
eyes with his beak, hobble-gobbling all the time most
furiously; in which praiseworthy endeavour he was
seconded by two ducks and a clucking-hen, one of whose
chickens had come to an untimely end through poor
Sally's <i>faux-pas</i>; while the original stumblingblock,
the pig, kept poking and snoking at the fallen fair
one, as if he had possessed a curiosity to know the
colour of her garters.  This gave little yellowhammer
an opportunity of picking up the cowskin, that had
dropped in the row, and of slyly dropping it into the
draw-well, to the great improvement, no doubt, of the
future flavour of the water.
</p>

<p>
At length Sally gathered herself up, and seeing that
there was no chance of catching the urchins, who
were peeping in at the back-door of the yard, that
opened into the lane, she made a merit of necessity,
and called out,
</p>

<p>
"So, go play now&mdash;go play,"&mdash;and away the scholars
ran, and Cousin Sally returned to the house.
</p>

<p>
I was sitting at breakfast, and the gig I had ordered
was already at the door, when the captain of the
Ballahoo, who had been put to bed in the house, joined
me.  He looked rather sheepish, as if a dim recollection
of the figure he had cut over night had been
haunting him.  Just as we had finished our meal, and
I was about saying good-by to him, I found I had
forgotten two boxes of cigars on board the Ballahoo; and
as none of the servants of the house were at hand, I
accepted his offer to go on board with him, in a canoe
for them.  So desiring the boy in charge of the gig to
wait&mdash;that I would be back <i>instanter</i>&mdash;we sallied
forth, and proceeded to the wharf, and embarked in the
first shore-canoe we came to.  There were three
West-Indiamen taking in their cargoes close to the wharf,
with their topmasts struck, and otherwise dismantled,
and derricks up; and a large timbership, just arrived,
whose sails were loosed to dry, was at anchor beyond
them in the bay.
</p>

<p>
"Pull under the stern of that large ship with the
sails loose; my brig is just beyond her," quoth Hause
to the black canoe-man.  "A fine burdensome craft
that, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Very."
</p>

<p>
We were now rapidly approaching the large vessel&mdash;we
shot past under her stern&mdash;when, lo!&mdash;<i>there was
no brig to be seen</i>.
</p>

<p>
The captain, apparently bewildered, stared wildly
about him&mdash;first this way, then that way, and in every
direction&mdash;-then at a buoy, to which we had now made
fast.&mdash;He turned round to me, while with one hand he
grasped the buoy-rope&mdash;"As sure as there is a
Heaven above us, sir&mdash;this is our buoy, and the brig is
gone."
</p>

<p>
"Gone," said I, smiling, "where can she be gone?"
</p>

<p>
"That's more than I know;"&mdash;then, after a pause,
during which he became as blue as indigo, "where is
the Ballahoo?" gasped the poor fellow in a fluttering
tone to the canoe-men, as if terrified to learn their
answer.
</p>

<p>
"Where is the Ballahoo you say, massa!!"&mdash;echoed
Quashie in great surprise, that <i>he</i>, the master of her,
should ask such a question.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;you black scoundrel,"&mdash;roared Hause,
gathering breath, "<i>where</i> is the Ballahoo?&mdash;this is her
buoy, don't you see?"
</p>

<p>
"Where is de Ballahoo!!!"&mdash;again screamed the
negroes, in a volley, in utter extremity of amazement
at the enquiry being <i>seriously</i> repeated.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, you ragamuffins," quoth I, Benjie Brail,
excited in my turn&mdash;"Where <i>is</i> the Ballahoo?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Omnes</i>.&mdash;"WHERE IS THE BALLAHOO?"
</p>

CHAPTER VII.
</h3>

<h4>
THE DEVIL'S GULLY.
</h4>

<p>
I was certainly extremely puzzled myself to
conjecture what could have become of the brig&mdash;that she
had vanished was certain&mdash;and as for poor Captain
Hause, he was in a truly pitiable state; quite stunned
with the suddenness and severity of the blow, so as to
be altogether unable to think or act for himself&mdash;"Come,
Hause, my lad," said I, encouragingly, "this
won't do; rouse yourself, man, and let us see what's
to be done."  At this he slowly rose up in the canoe,
rubbing his eyes, and pressing his forehead, as if he
had awakened out of some horrid dream, the effects of
which he was endeavouring to shake off; but the
instant he was no longer in doubt as to the reality of
his misfortune, he cast the slough of his despondency,
and with terrific energy tore off his jacket and
neckerchief, and dashing both into the water, along with
his hat, threw himself headlong after them; being
only prevented from accomplishing his purpose of
self-destruction by my dragging him on board again
by the leg, and then holding him in the canoe by main
force.
</p>

<p>
"I say, my men,"&mdash;to the black canoemen&mdash;"pull
to that big timber-ship, will ye?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, massa," rejoined the poor fellows; "only
hold dat poor mad buccra hand&mdash;take care him don't
get at we, please, massa&mdash;white somarry when him
blod up, bad enough&mdash;but when buccra beside
himself, for true and true&mdash;heigh, de devil, massa."
</p>

<p>
We soon got alongside of the Quebec ship.  Several
of the crew, in their dirty canvass trowsers, red
flannel shirts, and night-caps, were standing at the
gangway, apparently observing us.
</p>

<p>
"You are the mate of this ship?" said I to a
good-looking young man, who was leaning over the side,
neatly dressed in a blue jacket, check shirt, duck
trowsers, and straw hat.
</p>

<p>
"I am, sir&mdash;can I be of any service to you?"
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would lend a hand to get this poor
fellow up the side.  He is very ill, you see; and if I
try to take him ashore I am persuaded he will jump
overboard.  He has endeavoured to do so already."
</p>

<p>
"You need not be afraid of me, Mr Brail," here
chimed in the poor skipper himself, as he seated
himself in the stern sheets with forced composure.  "It
is over now, sir, and I am quite cool; but get up if
you please, and I will follow you&mdash;you are quite
right, sir, the people of this ship <i>may</i> be able to give
us some information."
</p>

<p>
I clambered up the high side of the vessel, and was
immediately followed by Hause and three of the
negroes belonging to the canoe.
</p>

<p>
"I am sorry Captain Batten is not on board,
gentlemen," quoth the mate; "but is there any thing I
can do for you?"
</p>

<p>
My companion was still unable to speak for himself.
He had sitten down on a carronade, resting his
head on his hand, the very picture of despondency.
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is a strange story altogether," said I;
"but did you notice when the brig, that anchored
close to you yesterday afternoon, got under weigh this
morning?"
</p>

<p>
"I did, sir.  I was on deck at the time."
</p>

<p>
The captain lifted up his head at this for a moment,
but presently fell back into his former state of
apparent stupor.
</p>

<p>
"I noticed two boats," continued the mate, "I
suppose from the shore, full of people, go to her
from the other side of the bay, and smart chaps they
were apparently&mdash;they loosed sails, and set them in
regular man-of-war fashion, and all the time you could
have heard a pin drop.  I will do them or the crew
the credit to say that I never saw a brig got under
weigh more handsomely in my life.  I had no conception
they could have got the anchor up so speedily."
</p>

<p>
"Anchor up!" groaned Hause; "why, <i>there&mdash;there</i>
is the anchor, cable and all," pointing to the
buoy.  "The brig is run away with by some piratical
rascals, sir," cried he, increasing his exclamation to a
roar&mdash;"the cable has been slipped&mdash;oh, I am ruined,
I am ruined&mdash;for ever ruined&mdash;the sweet little
Ballahoo has been cut out by pirates&mdash;as sure as fate, the
bloody pirates are off with her," and he burst into a
passion of tears, and wept like the veriest child.
</p>

<p>
"I really cannot say," rejoined the mate of the
timber-ship, most distressingly cool and composed; "but
she was in sight within this half hour from the deck.
Here, steward, hand me the captain's glass&mdash;I think I
shall be able to make her out from the maintop still."
</p>

<p>
This seemed to rouse poor Hause, who had relapsed
into his mute fit; and he was in the top in an instant.
"Hand me up the glass, my good fellow," cried he
impatiently to the mate, who was ascending the
rigging leisurely, with the glass slung at his back by
a leather strap&mdash;"the glass, if you please, the
glass&mdash;here I see her down to leeward there&mdash;there,
see&mdash;just over the Point."  And the poor fellow took a
long, anxious look towards the offing, steadying the
telescope against one of the topmast shrouds, and
speaking very quickly all the time, as I have seen one
do in a fever, to the mate, who stood by him in the top.
</p>

<p>
"Well, captain," I sung out, "what do you see?"
</p>

<p>
He did not answer me; but the mate of the ship
did.  "He says he sees the brig, sir, standing under
a crowd of sail to the northward and westward&mdash;two
small craft, like coasters, in company."
</p>

<p>
"Ask him to take a good look at these last, will ye?"
</p>

<p>
A pause.  "One is a schooner, he says, sir."
</p>

<p>
"And the other?"
</p>

<p>
"A felucca, sir."
</p>

<p>
"I thought so, by all that is unfortunate."  And
I turned away, walking aft very fast, when the
mate's voice from the top, hailing the deck,
evidently in great alarm, arrested me, and glued me to
the planks.
</p>

<p>
"Johnstone, Johnstone!"&mdash;This was to one of the
ship's people,&mdash;"come up here; come up into the
top&mdash;quick, or he will be over!" And the next
moment the telescope fell smash at my feet.  I could see
that Hause had cast himself down on the grating, and
was grovelling convulsively on his face.  At length,
in his struggles, one of his legs hung over; and I
thought he would have slipped through the mate's
fingers, and been dashed to pieces by the fall.  I
looked up enquiringly.
</p>

<p>
"He's in a fit, sir," cried the mate.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, seize him in the top, then&mdash;seize him
in the top."
</p>

<p>
But it was unnecessary; the poor fellow got over
this paroxysm also, to which the calmness of despair
now finally succeeded, and presently he came down on
deck.
</p>

<p>
"I will now give you no more trouble, Mr Brail,
you may depend on it; I am in my right senses
again, although ruined for ever; and all owing to my
infernal folly in not sleeping on board."
</p>

<p>
"Well, my good fellow," said I, "I question very
strongly if your <i>sleeping</i> on board would have made
the smallest difference, at least in your favour.  <i>If</i> she
has been forcibly carried off,&mdash;and I am sorry to say
it looks very like it,&mdash;the party must have been too
strong to have allowed <i>your</i> resistance to have been of
any avail.  In fact, the first thing they naturally would
have done must have been either to have secured you
below, or given you a more effectual <i>quietus</i>&mdash;you
understand me.  So nothing here is so bad, but it might
have been worse.  You are better as you are surely,
than a prisoner; or, worse still, amongst the fishes in
the bay?"
</p>

<p>
But I was cramming his ear against the stomach of
his sense.
</p>

<p>
"Those on deck would not have been caught in
this way had I been on board, take my word for it, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Probably not, probably not.  But who does the
brig belong to?"
</p>

<p>
"To myself, sir&mdash;entirely."
</p>

<p>
"And she was ensured?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, fully; but since she had arrived, of course
the underwriters are not liable for her having been
cut out.  Besides, sir, it will be made out a deviation,
as we were bound for Kingston, and had no right
to touch at Montego bay; although, God knows, we
did all for the best."
</p>

<p>
"These are questions that I cannot well answer.  As
to the deviation, I fear you are right, although, as you
say, you did it for the best; and if the underwriters
be liberal-minded men, this should weigh with them,
and I do hope they will settle.  However, cheer up,
man, and let us go and make our depositions before
the authorities, and send off information of the event
to the admiral at Kingston, and to your agent there,
as well as to the outports; let us take all the chances
of informing some of the squadron of the transaction.
You are bound to take every measure likely to afford
a chance of the recovery of the brig and property.  But
the poor Dons, have they been kidnapped as well as
the crew?"
</p>

<p>
"All on dem&mdash;ebery one on dem carry go along
wid dat terrible pirate willain," quoth one of the negro
canoemen.
</p>

<p>
"Aye, Quashie," said I, for I had forgotten the
blackies altogether, "what do <i>you</i> know about it?"
</p>

<p>
"I knows dis, massa&mdash;dat Jack, and Aby, and Pico
dere, was all out fis wid me in de canoe dis wery
marning, jost as de moon was setting, when one
buccra hail we fram de beach&mdash;'Canoe, ahoy,' him
say.&mdash;'Hillo,' say we."
</p>

<p>
"Very well, my good man, get on, get on."
</p>

<p>
"So me shall, massa; so him hail again, 'Canoe,
ahoy,' him say&mdash;and 'Hillo,' say me, Bill, once more."
</p>

<p>
"So, and you took him on board?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"You had better give him his own way, sir, or you
will never get to the end of his yarn," chimed in the
mate of the timber ship.  I saw he had a better knowledge
of the negro character than I had, so I resolutely
held my tongue.  "Go on, then, Bill, since that is
your name, get along your own way."
</p>

<p>
"So him hail, we de tird time&mdash;'Canoe, ahoy,'
him say.  I hope massa notice dat him sing out
'Canoe, ahoy,' for de <i>tird</i> time&mdash;'Hillo,' say I for de
tird time too&mdash;massa will mark I say 'Hillo,' for de
tird time too."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes."
</p>

<p>
"Wery good.  'I wants a shove out to one wessel
in de offing,' say de woice, for by dis time one
cloud come over de moon, and we couldn't see nobody
none at all&mdash;'We is fissing, and can't come,' say Pico."
</p>

<p>
"'Never mind your fissing&mdash;here is one golden
hook for you&mdash;here is eight dollar for de put on board.'
</p>

<p>
"Ho, ho, now we understan, taught I,&mdash;'He, he,
better more as fis whole night dis is,' say Jack.  So
we leave de lines, at one buoy, and pull for de beach,
where we find one buccra tan up dere wid portmanteau
on him shoulder, and all fine dress as if for one ball.
He toss in de portmanteau widout any more palaver&mdash;wery
heavy him was, for de same was break Pico shin."
</p>

<p>
"To be sure him do," said Pico, here showing where
the black cuticle was flayed off the cucumber shank.
</p>

<p>
"'Now you see one wessel, wid white sail out
yonder?' him say when him sit down in de starn
sheet&mdash;'No,' say all we, 'we see noting,' and no more we
did, massa.
</p>

<p>
"'Bery well&mdash;pull right out of de bay den&mdash;<i>one
doubloon if you pulls to please me,</i>' say he."
</p>

<p>
I here looked at poor Hause&mdash;forgetting he had
been helplessly drunk when the canoe passed us, as
we sat below the orange-tree.
</p>

<p>
"Well, massa," continued the negro, "when we
reach de offing de trange buccra tood up in de starn,
take off him hat, and look all about&mdash;'dere,' say he,
pointing wid him tretch out hand, 'dere dey are, you
see dem now, pull for dat nearest wessel.'
</p>

<p>
"'Where, where, where?'  Pico poke him head
out into de dark night, and so do Jack, and so do Aby,
and so do me&mdash;all tan up wid neck tretch over de
gonwale like so much goose looking for de picaniny
coming wid de Guinea corn.  So, tink I, what good
yeye dat buccra mos hab, for none of us yet no see
noting; but, ha, ha, presently de moon give us one
leetle shine, and, I see, I see."
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce did you see?" said I, losing all
patience, and raising my hand threateningly&mdash;Quashie,
thinking I was going to strike him, now tumbled out
his words fast enough.
</p>

<p>
"I see one larsh ship well out in de offing&mdash;one
leetle rogueish looking felucca close to, and one big
topsail schooner between dis one and de larsh ship."  Here,
seeing it was a false alarm on my part, he relapsed
into his former drawling verbosity.  "Well, we pull
for de smallest of de tree&mdash;see no one on deck but de
man steering and two boy&mdash;de trange buccra shomp
on board&mdash;'Now tank you, my lad,' him say quite
shivel&mdash;'dere is de doubloon I promise&mdash;here, boy,
give dem poor fellow a horn of grog a-piece.'&mdash;'Si
Señor,' say de boy&mdash;fonny ting, I taught, for de boy
to hanswer him in Panish&mdash;we drink de grog&mdash;'now
shove off&mdash;good by&mdash;go home, and sleep,' said de
trange buccra&mdash;but instead we come back to our nets,
massa&mdash;before daybreak we come ashore, and when
de captain dere engage de canoe, we taught it was
for join de brig in de offing (for after we came
back from sell our fis we hear she was gone), until
we see she was too far out, and instead of being heave
too, was bowl along six knots wid de first of de sea
breeze."
</p>

<p>
"How came you to know Captain Hause was the
master of the brig?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Because I was in de pilot canoe dat was come aff
to you yesterday&mdash;and it make me wery mosh surprise
to see de captain expect to find de brig at anchor dis
forenoon, for I never dream she could be go widout
his leave.  I was tink for true it was him send him
off at gone-fire, becase I see, just before day broke,
what I tink was two sore boat wid peoples, as if he
had sent help to up de hanker cleverly&mdash;dat all I
knows, massa&mdash;will buss de book pan dat."  And I
believe the poor fellow spoke the truth.
</p>

<p>
It was now evident beyond all shadow of doubt that
the Ballahoo had been run away with by pirates, and
it was equally clear that nothing could be done with
any chance of success in the way of venturing to
follow her in an unarmed craft.
</p>

<p>
As for poor Hause, it would have been downright
cruelty if I had left him that forenoon.  So I told
Cousin Teemoty to put up the gig, as I found I should
be unable to leave Montego bay that day at any rate;
and I hurried to Sally Frenche's in order to write to
the admiral an account of the transaction.
</p>

<p>
When I got there I found Mr Twig and his friend
Mr Flamingo seated at a sumptuous breakfast.  "Good
morning, gentlemen&mdash;melancholy news for you this
morning.  This poor man's brig&mdash;the vessel I came
in&mdash;has been run away with in the night by pirates."
</p>

<p>
"By pirates!" said Flamingo; "impossible, Mr
Brail, you are joking surely.  I would as soon believe
that Jacob Twig there had been stolen in the night."
</p>

<p>
"And do you mean to say I should not have been
worth the stealing, Felix?"
</p>

<p>
I assured them that it was a melancholy fact, and
no jest, but neither would believe that there was any
piracy in the affair&mdash;"Piracy&mdash;poo, poo,
impossible&mdash;barratry of the crew&mdash;barratry to a certainty."
</p>

<p>
"No," quoth Hause; "I would trust the poor
fellows with all that I am worth&mdash;Heaven knows that's
little enough now.  The mate is my own brother-in-law,
and the second mate is my nephew, my own
sister's son.  No barratry, sir; no, no."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," said I, "you have shown, gentlemen,
a desire to oblige me already.  I now will put you to
the proof."
</p>

<p>
Here they laid down their coffee-cups and rose,
wiping their muzzles with their napkins most resolutely.
</p>

<p>
"Say the word, Mr Brail," quoth both in a breath,
with their mouths full, and munching away all the
time&mdash;"how can we be of service?&mdash;with our persons
or purses?  We West Indians have such a slippery
tenure in this country, that one does not much grudge
perilling either," continued Jacob Twig.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you.  All I want at present is, that you
should have the goodness to put Mr Hause and me in
the way of making our depositions before your chief
magistrate."
</p>

<p>
"The custos of the parish?" quoth Twig.  "Certainly&mdash;and
fortunately he is here in Montego bay at
this moment.  He was at Roseapple's last night."
</p>

<p>
"I know where to find him," said Mr Flamingo,
"He is always at old Jacob Munroe's store about this
time, when at the bay.  So, <i>allons</i>."
</p>

<p>
And in a twinkling we were on our way to lay our
troubles before the great functionary, an extensive
planter in the neighbourhood."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, where is Mr Turner, the gentleman from
Falmouth, who brought that ominous Mr Wilson to
the ball, to be found?" said I, as we stumped along,
larding the lean earth, for it was cruelly hot.
</p>

<p>
"Well thought of," said Don Felix.  "He lodges
usually at Judy Wade's.  Why, there he is in <i>propria
persona</i>, standing in the front piazza."
</p>

<p>
"How do you do, Turner?  You will have heard
the row on the bay?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes; but the Tom Bowline has been given
up; she has not even been plundered, and is now
working into the bay."
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;no&mdash;not the Tom Bowline"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"What, about the brig having been cut out?  Oh
yes; it has flown like wild-fire."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, is Mr Wilson still with you?"
</p>

<p>
"No, to my surprise (I will confess), he is not.  It
seems he came home before me from Roseapple's,
packed his portmanteau, paid half of our joint bills, and
bolted"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Honour amongst thieves," whispered Twig to me&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But where he is gone I can't tell.  He <i>did</i> intend
to have started for Kingston to-day at one time, but
last night he said he would put it off until to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
"There again," said I, looking at Jacob, who seemed
to think it was his cue.
</p>

<p>
"He must be a bit of a rogue that same Wilson; so
I hope he is no friend of yours, Turner, <i>my dear
fellow</i>," quoth Twig&mdash;and here he told him of all that had
occurred, and what we suspected.
</p>

<p>
Mr Turner, a most respectable man, was highly
incensed at having been so grossly duped, and willingly
accompanied us to the place where we expected to find
the custos.
</p>

<p>
We were on our way, when the mate of the timber
ship overtook us, running very fast.
</p>

<p>
"Gentlemen, piracy is not the worst of it&mdash;piracy is
not the worst of it.  <i>There has been murder committed</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Murder!" quoth Jacob Twig&mdash;"the deuce there has!"
</p>

<p>
"Murder!" quoth Don Felix&mdash;"worse, and more of it."
</p>

<p>
And, "murder!" quoth I Benjie.  "Where, my
good man?&mdash;and what proof?"
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, gentlemen," said the still breathless
seaman.  "The ship's boat, with Captain Batten
himself in it, is lying at the wharf.  Come with me,
and you shall see yourselves that it is as I say."
</p>

<p>
We reached the wharf, and immediately pulled
straight for the brig's buoy.
</p>

<p>
As we got between it and the sun, which was now
declining in the west, we witnessed a very uncommon
appearance.
</p>

<p>
The Ballahoo had let go her anchor in five fathoms
water, so clear, and the sand at the bottom so white
and free of weeds or rocks, that when we were about
&amp; cable's length distant from the anchor, it appeared
from the refraction of the sun's rays, to be buoyed up,
and to float on the surface of the gentle swell that
rolled in from the offing&mdash;the shank, flukes, and stock
twisting and twining, and the cable waving in its
whole length, as if the solid anchor had been a living
thing in the fangs of a gigantic watersnake.  When
we got right over the anchor, we saw a dark object,
at about three fathoms to windward of it, of the size of
a man's body, glimmering and changing its shape, from
the jaugle of the water.  At the request of the mate I
shaded my eyes with my hands, and held my face close
to the surface, when the indistinct appearance, as I
looked steadily, settled itself into the figure of a sailor,
floating, as near as I could judge, midway between the
bottom and the surface; suspended in the water, as the
fable alleges Mahomet's coffin to be in air.
</p>

<p>
"It has drifted," said the mate, "since I was here
before, and is now much nearer the surface&mdash;see,
see!"&mdash;and presently the dead corpse, as if some
sudden chemical decomposition had taken place, sent up a
number of bubbles, and then rose rapidly to the
surface with a bob (if in so serious a matter one may use
such an expression), where it floated with the breast
bone and face flush with the surface of the swell,
dip dipping, and driving out small concentric circles,
that sparkled in the sun all round.  <i>The throat was
cut from ear to ear</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Great God," cried poor Hause, as he passed his
arm round the neck of the dead body, and raised it out
of the water&mdash;"my poor mate&mdash;my poor mate!  Ay,
ay&mdash;he would have the morning watch sure enough.
A fearful watch has it been to him."
</p>

<p>
We carried the body to the wharf, and left it there,
covered with a boatsail, and once more proceeded to
wait on the custos.
</p>

<p>
The place we expected to meet him at was a sort
of vendue store, the small open piazza of which,
fronting the street, was lumbered with bales of Osnaburgs,
open boxes of handkerchiefs, pieces of Irish linens, and
several open barrels of mess beef, pork, pickled mackerel,
herrings, and shads.  We navigated through
these shoals with some difficulty, and considerable
danger to the integrity and purity of our coat skirts.  At
length we reached the interior.
</p>

<p>
There was a passage fronting us, that ran right
through the house from front to rear, on each side of
which were sparred partitions of unpainted pine boards,
covered with flour and weevils, and hung with saddlery,
mule harness, cattle chains, hoes, and a vast variety
of other miscellaneous articles of common use on an
estate.
</p>

<p>
Through the spars on the left hand side, I saw a
person in a light-coloured jacket and trowsers, perched
on the top of a tall mahogany tripod, at a small, dirty,
hacked-and-hewn mahogany desk, with a pen behind
his ear, his hands full of papers, and busy apparently
with some accounts.
</p>

<p>
But there seemed to be a dark <i>sanctum-sanctorum</i>
beyond him, of some kind or another, railed in
separately, the partition festooned with dusty spider-webs,
and raised several steps above the level of the floor.
Here, in the obscurity, I could barely discern a little
decrepit figure of a man, like a big parrot in a cage,
dressed in a sort of dark-coloured night-gown and red
night-cap.
</p>

<p>
We all sat down unconcernedly to wait for his
honour, as if this had been some common lounge, or a sort
of public coffee-house,&mdash;some on tops of barrels, others
on bales or boxes; but neither of the two persons at
the desks moved or took the smallest notice of us, as
if they had been accustomed to people constantly going
and coming.
</p>

<p>
"Where is your master?" said Twig at length to
a negro that was tumbling goods about in the piazza.
</p>

<p>
"Dere him is," quoth Snowball&mdash;"dere in de contin
hose;" indicating the direction by sticking out his chin,
both paws being occupied at the time in rolling a tierce
of beef.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Jacob Munroe," sung out Twig&mdash;"how
are you, old boy?  Nuzzling away in the old corner,
I see."
</p>

<p>
"Hoo are ye?  Hoo are ye the day, Mr Twig?"
said a small husky voice from the sanctum.
</p>

<p>
I happened to sit a good deal farther back in the
passage than the others of the party (farther <i>ben</i> I
believe they would call it in Scotland), and thus could
hear the two quill drivers, who were evidently unaware
of my being within earshot, communing with each
other, while my companions did not.
</p>

<p>
"Saunders," quoth the oldest man from the sanctum,
"hae ye coonted the saydels?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, uncle, twice over, and there is still one amissing."
</p>

<p>
"Vara extraordinar," rejoined the small husky voice
from the dark corner&mdash;"Vara extraordinar."&mdash;Then
after a pause&mdash;"Hae ye closed aw the accoonts, Saunders?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Whilk o' them are open yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Mr Wanderson's."
</p>

<p>
"Ane," said the voice.
</p>

<p>
"Jolliffe and Backhouse."
</p>

<p>
"Twa."
</p>

<p>
"Skinflint and Peasemeal."
</p>

<p>
"Three."
</p>

<p>
"His honour the custos."
</p>

<p>
"Four."
</p>

<p>
"And Gabriel Juniper."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, there's five o' them.  Weel-a-weel, Saunders,
we maunna lose the value of the saydel at no rate&mdash;sae
just clap in, 'item, <i>one</i> saydel' to ilk ane o' the five
ye hae read aff the noo seriawtim&mdash;they'll no aw
objeck&mdash;ane will surely stick&mdash;maybe mair."
</p>

<p>
I was a good deal amused with this, and while the
others were inspecting some sets of harness, and the
quality of several open boxes of soap, I could not resist
drawing nearer, under the lee of the partition, to enjoy
the fun of the thing.  Presently Twig joined me.
</p>

<p>
The conscience of the younger of the two invisibles
seemed to rebel somewhat at this national and
characteristic method of balancing an account, and making
gain of the loss of a saddle.
</p>

<p>
"Really, uncle, <i>none</i> of these parties got the saddle,
I am positively certain of <i>that</i>."
</p>

<p>
"It's no my fawt if they didna&mdash;we canna lose the
saydel, Saunders; by no mainer of means."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, but, sir," persisted the other, "Mr Wanderson,
for instance, a person you always speak so highly of!"
</p>

<p>
"Haud yere tongue, sir, and do as I bid ye&mdash;it'll
no be charged again <i>yere</i> conscience, and yere no the
keeper o' mine."
</p>

<p>
I was amazingly tickled at this.&mdash;After a pause,
"Hae ye charged the saydels yet, Saunders?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said the clerk, doggedly; "yes, all
charged, and I'm just closing the accounts."
</p>

<p>
"Close nane o' the accounts&mdash;the devil's in the lad
wi' his hurry&mdash;close nane o' the accounts, sir&mdash;so noo
charge twa three odd things till each o' the five, just,
to smoor the saydel, ye ken&mdash;what are ye glowering
at?&mdash;do ye no understaun yere mither tongue?&mdash;to mak
the charge less noticeable, ye gawmarel."
</p>

<p>
"Really, sir," said the younger of the two, "I have
not the courage to do so unjust an action of myself."
</p>

<p>
"Haud yere tongue, and write what I dictate, then,
sir&mdash;wha's first?  Ay, Mr Wanderson.  Let me see&mdash;an
IHL hinge, a negro lock, and a bottle of
blister flies, to Mr Wanderson.  He's always giving poor
people help and medicine, and he'll ne'er notice them.
Wha's neist?"
</p>

<p>
"The custos, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, the custos," said the voice; "a jovial chiel
is his honour&mdash;so, so&mdash;just clap doon, item, twa
<i>pawtent</i> corkscrews.  He's no very muckle gien to payin',
but ne'er mind&mdash;I'll <i>screw</i> it out o' him in rum and
plantains."  And here the creature laughed an "eldritch
laugh," sounding more like <i>keck, keck, keck</i>, than
any common cachinnation.  "Wha's neist?"
</p>

<p>
"Jolliffe and Backhouse."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, braw English lads are they baith; leeberal
chiels, and fond o' guid eating&mdash;clap a round o' Jew
beef on the tap o' <i>their</i> saydel.&mdash;Keck, keck, keck.
Wha's neist?"
</p>

<p>
"Skinflint and Peasemeal, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Bah&mdash;nasty Scotch bodies" (and what may you
be, thought I); "and weel I wot I would be glad to
saydel them&mdash;keck, keck&mdash;but they'll no be fitted that
gate, I trow&mdash;they are owre gleg; sell them a loose,
and if he wanted a leg or the fud&mdash;my certie, let abee
findin' it oot, they wad plea it afore they payed it&mdash;sae
pass them ower.  But wait awee&mdash;I am loath to let
Skinflint escape after aw.  Hoo mony grunstanes did
their cart ca' for the other day?"
</p>

<p>
"Two dozen, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Twa dizzen&mdash;twa dizzen grunstanes, did ye say?&mdash;herd
ony mortal the like o' that&mdash;four-and-twenty
grunstanes!  What can they do wi' sae mony? they
maun surely mack soup o' them, or feed their negers
wi' them, or maybe they grind their noses on them,
ay, that'll be it&mdash;keck, keck&mdash;Did you send an invoice
wi' the cart, Saunders?"
</p>

<p>
"No, sir; the man went away without it."
</p>

<p>
"Vera weel."
</p>

<p>
"The cart upset on the way home, sir, and broke
several of the stones, I hear."
</p>

<p>
"Better and better&mdash;mak the <i>twa dizzen three</i>,
Saunders; surely they'll no piece the broken anes
thegither to check the tally&mdash;the extra dizzen will aboot
balance a saydel, Saunders.  So, if we canna fit them
wi' a saydel, we'll tak a ride aff them bare-backed.&mdash;Keck,
keck, keck.  Wha's neist?"
</p>

<p>
"Gabriel Juniper, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Fashious, drucken neerdoweel&mdash;wash his saydel
down wi' a gallon o' gin and twa o' brandy.  He'll no
be able to threep wi' me, for he's amaist aye drunk
noo&mdash;sin' he couldna keep his ain saydel the last time I
saw him on horseback, it's but richt he should pay for
the lost ane&mdash;Keck, keck, keck.  Noo, Saunders, ye're
a decent lad, sae satisfy yere conscience, and mind ye
gie up, in shape o' discoont, at the settlement, the
amount o' aw the <i>fictitious</i> items, <i>barring</i> the saydels
and the grunstanes, though&mdash;mind that&mdash;barring the
saydels and the grunstanes.  Noo, soom up and close,
ye deevil&mdash;soom up and close."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, custos," said Mr Turner, as the gentleman
we were waiting for entered, "glad to see you, glad to
see you."  Here, having explained how matters stood,
his honour retired with us into Jacob Munroe's back
store.
</p>

<p>
"Well, namesake, how are you?" said Twig to the
old man who owned the small voice, and who now
emerged and became visible, as he crept before us and
opened the door.
</p>

<p>
"Oo, fine, Maister Twig, fine&mdash;did ye fin' the
accoonts against Roaring River and Hector's Folly
estates aw correct, Mr Twig?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all correct, all correct; only you have charged
me a saddle too many."
</p>

<p>
The old withered anatomy looked with a quizzical
leer of his eye at him, as much as to say, "have you
overheard me, master Twig?&mdash;but I am rich and
don't care."
</p>

<p>
"Saunders," cried the old man, "I say, Saunders,
bring the ink and <i>ae</i> chair for the custos and the
gentlemen," as if we all could have sat upon <i>one</i>; "and,
Abr<i>a</i>h<i>aa</i>m," to one of the store negroes, "shool away
that shell into a corner, and gie them room."
</p>

<p>
"Shell," said I, in some surprise; "why, is that
great mass all tortoise-shell?"
</p>

<p>
"Atweel is it, young gentleman; at least it is the
shell of the hawk's-bill turtle, which is the same thing.
That's the last cargo of the Jenny Nettles, frae the
Indian coast&mdash;she sould be up again aboot this time,
if she be na <i>cacht</i> by they incarnate deevils o'
peerates&mdash;but she's weel assured, she's weel assured.  Why,
Saunders!&mdash;whar the deevil are ye, Saunders?"
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir," said the young man whom I had seen
at the desk, as he entered with writing materials in
one hand, a chair for his <i>Honour</i> in the other, and a
Bible (as he naturally concluded that some depositions
on oath were to be taken) <i>in his teeth</i>.  I paid no
particular attention to him until he startled me by suddenly
dropping the chair on Twig's toes, exclaiming, as
he caught the Bible in his hand, "Gude hae a care o'
us, Mr Brail, is this you yeersell?"&mdash;And lo, who
should stand before me, but our old friend Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"Why, old shipmate, how are you?&mdash;I am glad to
see you; but I thought you had turned coffee-planter
by this time?"
</p>

<p>
"And so I have, sir.  My uncle there sends me up
the end of every week to superintend his plantation in
the mountains; but I am here for the most part of my
time in the store, helping him.  But where are you
lodging, Mr Brail?  I hope you will permit me to
call on you; for I see you are likely to be engaged at
present."
</p>

<p>
I told him where I staid, and in few words what the
reader knows already regarding my Jamaica expectations
and the cause of my visit; farther, that I was
about leaving town, but that I would not fail having a
chat with him soon, as I should no doubt be often at
the bay.
</p>

<p>
The custos, after taking our depositions, wrote to
the admiral at Port-Royal, and to correspondents of
his at all the outports, with an outline of the
circumstances, in case any of His Majesty's ships should be
there; and in the mean time it was determined that
poor Hause, after giving his underwriters in Kingston
notice of his calamity, should remain at Montego bay
until it was seen what should turn up.  Here I must
do old Jacob Munroe justice.  Before the meeting
broke up, he in our presence invited him to stay in
his house as long as it suited him.  Lennox, seeing I
was surprised at this, whispered in my ear, that, "Snell
as his uncle was in business matters, the auld-farrant
body had a warm heart still to a fellow-creature in
distress."
</p>

<p>
"Come along, Mr Brail," said Flamingo&mdash;"as we
cannot make a start of it this evening now, let us
adjourn to our friend Sally's, and see what entertainment
she can provide for us; and then hey for Ballywindle
at daybreak to-morrow."
</p>

<p>
However, our troubles were not over for that day;
for we had not proceeded fifty yards on our way to our
lodgings, when an ugly bloated drunken-looking white
man, with great flabby yellow cheeks, that shook as he
walked like flannel-bags full of jelly, and in a most
profuse perspiration, driven forth, I make no doubt, by
a glorious rummer of grog, came up to us, and touched
both of us on the shoulder&mdash;most people are rather
sensitive regarding a touch thereabouts, so we faced
suddenly round.
</p>

<p>
"I warn you bote, gentlemen, to attend one
coroner's inquest at Jacob Munroe's wharf."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce you do?" said I.  "Pray, what
authority have you for this, my fine fellow?"
</p>

<p>
"De coroner's warrant, sir," producing it.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, we are nailed, Mr Brail," quoth Don Felix.
"Crowner's Quest law is not to be disputed&mdash;no use
in kicking.  So pray, my good man, do you want any
more jurors?"
</p>

<p>
"Indeed I do, sare.  You are de first I have warn
as yet."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, then, do you see that red-faced gentleman
coming round the corner there?"
</p>

<p>
"Yesh, I do," said the man.
</p>

<p>
"Then bone him <i>instanter</i>, or he will bolt."  This
was no less a personage than Jacob Twig again.  The
man on this made a detour, and took our friend in
flank, but the moment Jacob saw him he seemed to
suspect his object, and began to walk down the street
very fast, followed by the constable.  There was a
narrow turning to the right, near to where we stood,
that led amongst a nest of <i>nanny</i> houses, as they are
called, inhabited by brown free people, which was quite
closed up by a party washing clothes and a girl
milking a cow beyond them.  How Jacob was to escape,
if his evil genius should prompt him to try this
channel, I could not conceive.  As yet his sense of
propriety had only allowed him to get into a very fast
walk.  Shamming deafness, however, all the while, to
the reiterated shouts of the constable, to "stand in de
Kin's name;" but the moment he opened the lane, off he
started, with the long skirts of his frogged coat streaming
in the wind, and his little glazed hat blazing in the
sun like a meteor, or the steel headpiece of one of
Bonaparte's cuirassiers.
</p>

<p>
There was an old woman stooping down over her
tub, right fronting him, that is, facing him in an Irish
fashion, for she looked t'other way from him, and two
younger ones, similarly employed on each side of her.
How he was to clear them and their tubs, and the cow
beyond, was the puzzle, as the projecting eaves of the
two lines of small houses, whose inmates were thus
employed, nearly met overhead.  However, we were not
left long in suspense.  Massa Twig now quickened
his pace, and clapping his hands on the old lady's
shoulders, cleared her and her tub cleverly by a
regular leap-frog, <i>tipping</i> the heads of the two young
women on each flank with his toes, and alighted at the
feet of the girl who was milking the cow, which had
not time to start before he followed up the fun by
vaulting on her back; and then charged down the lane
through the tubs and over the prostrate constable,
passing us like a whirlwind, the quadruped funking up
her heels, and tossing the dry sand with her horns, as
if <i>startled</i> by a myriad of gad-flies.  Both Flamingo
and I strained our eyes to follow him, as he flew along
like smoke, careering down the lane that ended in the sea.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't he throw himself off?" said I; "the
frantic brute is making straight for the water&mdash;it will
drown him if he don't."
</p>

<p>
"Jump off, man&mdash;jump off," roared Don Felix.
But in vain; for the next moment there was Jacob
Twig of the Dream, in St Thomas in the East, flashing
and splashing in the sea, cow and all, an Irish
illustration of the fable of Europa.  Presently both
biped and quadruped were in deep water, when they
parted company, and all that we could see was a glazed
hat and a red face, and a redder face and a pair of horns,
making for the shore again as fast as they could.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Twig is cheap of that," quoth Flamingo.
"He is always aiming at something out of the way,
and certainly he has accomplished it this time; but,
see, there are people about him, so he is safe."
</p>

<p>
However, we were boned, and could not escape, so
having lost sight of him, we waited until the poor
constable, a German, had gathered himself up and joined
us.&mdash;"And now, Master Constable, lead the way, if
you please."
</p>

<p>
"Who is dat mans, as is mad?" quoth he, as soon
as he could speak.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Purvis of Tantallon, near Lacovia," said
Flamingo, as grave as a judge.
</p>

<p>
"What a thumper," thought I Benjie.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at the wharf, when the coroner immediately
impanelled the jury, and we proceeded to view
the body of the poor fellow who had been murdered.
It was lying on the wharf, covered with the sail as we
had left it; from under which, notwithstanding the
short time it had been exposed, thick fetid
decomposed matter crept in several horrible streams, and
dripped into the clear green sea beneath, through the
seams of the planking, where the curdling blue drops
were eagerly gobbled up by a shoal of small fish;
while a myriad of large blue-bottles rose with a loud
hum from the cloth, as it was removed on our approach,
but only to settle down the next moment more thickly
than before, on the ghastly spectacle.&mdash;Bah.&mdash;Even in
the short period that the body had been in the water,
the features were nearly obliterated, and the hands
much gnawed; three of the fingers were gone entirely
from the left.  The windpipe and gullet were both
severed with a horrible gash, and there was a deep
bruised indentation across the forehead, as if from the
heavy blow of a crowbar, or some other blunt weapon.
There was no doubt on earth but that the poor
fellow had been surprised and met his death by violence,
and so suddenly that he could not give the alarm; so
a verdict was accordingly returned of "wilful murder,
against a person or persons unknown."
</p>

<p>
By the time we returned to our lodgings we found
Massa Twig fresh rigged after his exertions, and as
full of frolic and oddity as ever.
</p>

<p>
"Did you ever see a female bull so well actioned
before, Felix?" said he.
</p>

<p>
"Never," replied his friend,&mdash;"took the water like
a spaniel too&mdash;must be accustomed to the sea&mdash;an
Alderney cow, I suppose, Twig, eh?"
</p>

<p>
This evening passed on without any thing further
occurring worth recording.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, Lennox came to see me off, and gave
me all his news.  I was exceedingly glad to learn
that the poor fellow was so happily situated, and
promised to call on him the first time I came to the bay.
</p>

<p>
While lounging about the piazza before breakfast,
I noticed our friend Quacco busily employed cleaning
a fowling-piece.
</p>

<p>
"Whose gun is that, Quacco?"
</p>

<p>
"Massa Flamingo's, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Let me see it&mdash;a nice handy affair&mdash;Purdy, I
perceive&mdash;comes to my shoulder very readily,
beautifully."
</p>

<p>
"Wery clever leetle gone, for sartain, massa; but
all de caps dem spoil, sir.  See de powder&mdash;percossion
dem call&mdash;quite moist, and useless."  By this
time he had fitted on one of the copper caps, and
snapped the piece, but it was dumb.  "I am
going to fill de caps wid fresh powder, massa; but
really dis percossion powder too lively, massa&mdash;only
see"&mdash;and he gave a few grains of it a small tip with
the shank of the bullet mould, when it instantly flashed up.
</p>

<p>
"Master Quacco," said I, "mind your hand; that
is dangerous stuff.  Tell Mr Flamingo to be wary also,
or he will be shooting people, for it is wrong mixed, I
am certain."
</p>

<p>
"Wery trang, wery trang for sartain, massa&mdash;but
no fear in my hand&mdash;for I is armourer, as well as
waiting gentleman&mdash;oh, ebery ting is I Quacco."
</p>

<p>
"Confound your self-conceit."
</p>

<p>
Here Flamingo and Twig came in.
</p>

<p>
"Good morning, Mr Brail."
</p>

<p>
"Good morning."
</p>

<p>
"All ready for the start, I see," said Twig.  "Why,
Felix, what is Mr Brail's man doing with your gun?"
</p>

<p>
"Cleaning it, and filling these caps anew with
fresh percussion powder: the old has mildewed, or got
damp, he tells me.  Indeed, the last time I shot, it was
not one in three that exploded."
</p>

<p>
"Mind how you play with those caps," said I; but
before I could proceed&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Sally, make haste and get breakfast," bawled Twig.
"<i>Do you hear?</i>"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, massa," squeaked Sal from the profundities
of the back premises.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Felix," continued our friend, "there has
been another burglary last night: My <i>spleuchan</i>, as
Rory Macgregor calls it, has been ravished of its
treasures."
</p>

<p>
"How poetical you are this morning!&mdash;mounted
on your Pegasus, I see," rejoined Felix.
</p>

<p>
"Better that than the horned animal that led me such
a dance yesterday," quoth his friend, laughing.  "But,
joking apart, your man Twister must have mistaken
my tobacco for his own: He has emptied my tobacco-pouch,
as sure as fate, for none of my own people <i>eat</i>
it; and the fellow has always that capacious hole in
his ugly phiz filled with it&mdash;with my prime patent
chewing tobacco, as I am a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
"Really," said Felix, who detested tobacco in all
shapes, as I learned afterwards, with an accent conveying
as clearly as if he had said it&mdash;"I am deuced glad
to hear it."  Then, "Confound it, are we never to get
breakfast?  But when did you miss it, Jacob?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, when we got out to ride over Mount
Diablo, at the time the boys were leading the
gig-horses;&mdash;don't you recollect that I had to borrow
Twister's spurs, as Dare-devil always requires a
persuader when a donkey is in the path, and there were
half-a-dozen, you know?  So, stooping to adjust
them, out tumbled my spleuchan, it appears.  I did
not know it at the time, indeed not until we were
getting into the gig again, when Twister handed the
pouch, that was so well filled when it dropped, as
lank and empty as your own carcass, Flam."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo! what does it signify?" said his ally.
"A fair exchange, Twig&mdash;tobacco for spurs, you
know&mdash;a simple <i>quid pro quo</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Shame!" said Jacob; "I thought you were above
picking up such crumbs, Felix.  But here is
breakfast&mdash;so, come."
</p>

<p>
We finished it; and as we were getting ready, I
noticed Quacco and Massa Twig in earnest confabulation,
both apparently like to split with suppressed
laughter.  At some of the latter's suggestions, our
sable ally absolutely doubled himself up, while the
tears were running over his cheeks.  Immediately
afterwards, Quacco began to busy himself, boring
some of the small hard seeds of the sand-box tree
with his pricker, and filling them with something;
and then to poke and pare some pieces of Jacob's
patent flake tobacco with a knife, stuffing it into the
latter's tobacco-pouch.  However, I paid no more
attention to them, and we started; my cousin
Teemoty driving me in a chartered gig.
</p>

<p>
We shoved along at a brisk rate, close in the wake
of Mr Twig's voiture, and followed by a <i>plump</i> of
black cavaliers&mdash;a beautiful little sumpter-mule, loaded
with two portmanteaus, leading the cavalcade; while
Mr Flamingo's servant Twister pricked a-head, for the
twofold purpose of driving the mule and clearing the
road of impediments, such as a few stray jackasses, or
a group of negroes going to market, neither of whom
ever get out of one's way.
</p>

<p>
After proceeding about ten miles, the road wound
into a cocoa-nut grove close to the beach; indeed,
the beach <i>became</i> the road for a good mile, with the
white surf rolling in and frothing over the beautiful
hard sand, quickly obliterating all traces of the wheels.
Macadam was at a discount here.  One fine
peculiarity of the West India seas is, independent of
their crystal clearness, they are always brimfull&mdash;no
steamy wastes of slush and slime, no muddy tideways.
And overhead the sea-breeze was whistling through
the tall trees, making their long feather-like leaves
rustle and <i>rattle</i> like a thousand watchmen's alarms
sprung in the midst of a torrent of rain, or a fall of
<i>peas</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo! what is that?" as a cocoa-nut fell bang
into the bottom of my gig, and bounded out again like
a foot-ball.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, only a cocoa-nut," said Twig, looking over
his shoulder with the usual knowing twist of his
mouth, but without pulling up.
</p>

<p>
"Only a cocoa-nut!  But it would have fractured a
man's skull, I presume, if it had struck him."
</p>

<p>
"A white man's certainly," quoth Flamingo, with
all the coolness in life, as if it had fallen a hundred
miles from me, in place of barely shaving the point of
my nose: "But it <i>has not</i> hit you&mdash;a miss is as good
as a mile, you know; so suppose we go and bathe
until they get dinner ready yonder.  Let us send the
boys on to the tavern to order dinner.  We are within
two miles of it, Jacob&mdash;eh?"
</p>

<p>
"No, no," quoth Twig; "come along a quarter of
a mile further, and I will show you a nook within the
reef where we shall be safe from John Shark, or
rather the sharks will be safe from Flamingo's bones
there.  He would be like a sackful of wooden ladles
tossed to them.  The fish would find him as digestible
as a bag of nutcrackers, seasoned with cocoa-nut
shells&mdash;ah!&mdash;but come along, come along.  Oh such
a bath, Mr Brail, as I will show you!"
</p>

<p>
We left the cocoa-nut grove, and when we arrived
at the spot indicated we got out to reconnoitre.  There
was a long reef, about musket-shot from the beach at
the widest, on the outside of which the swell broke in
thunder, the strong breeze blowing the spray and
flakes of frothy brine back in our faces, even where
we stood.
</p>

<p>
The reef, like a bow, hemmed in a most beautiful
semicircular pool of green sea water, clear as crystal;
its surface darkened and crisped by tiny blue sparkling
wavelets, which formed a glorious and pellucid
covering to the forest, if I may so speak, of coral
branches and seaferns that covered the bottom, and
which, even where deepest, were seen distinctly in
every fibre.  When you held your face close to the
water, and looked steadily into its pure depths, you
saw the bottom at three fathoms perfectly alive, and
sparkling with shoals of fishes of the most glowing
colours, gamboling in the sun, birdlike amongst
the boughs, as if conscious of their safety from their
ravenous comrades outside; while nothing could be
more beautiful than the smooth sparkling silver sand
as the water shoaled towards the beach.  The last was
composed of a belt of small transparent pebbles, about
ten yards wide, overhung by a rotten bank of turf of
the greenest and most fragrant description, that had
been only sufficiently undermined by the lap lapping
of the water at tempestuous spring-tides (at no time
rising here above three feet), to form a continuous
although rugged bench the whole way along the
shore.
</p>

<p>
"Now, if one were riding incautiously here, he
might break his horse's leg without much trouble,"
quoth Don Felix.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jacob, speaking of horsemanship, how did
you like your style of immersion yesterday?&mdash;a novel
sort of bathing-machine, to be sure."
</p>

<p>
"You be hanged, Felix," quoth his ally, with
a most quizzical grin, as he continued his peeling.
</p>

<p>
"Do you know I've a great mind to try an
equestrian dip myself," persisted his friend.  "Here,
Twister&mdash;take off Monkey's saddle, and bring him
here."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see what you would be at," said Jacob.
"Romulus, bring me Dare-devil&mdash;so"&mdash;and thereupon,
to my great surprise and amazement, it pleased
my friends to undress under a neighbouring clump of
trees, and to send the equipages and servants on to
the tavern, about half a mile distant.  They then
mounted two led horses, bare-backed, with watering
bits, and, naked as the day they were born, with the
exception of a red handkerchief tied round Mr Twig's
head and down his redder cheeks, they dashed right
into the sea.
</p>

<p>
As cavalry was an arm I had never seen used with
much effect at sea, I swam out to the reef, and there
<i>plowtering</i> about in the dead water, under the lee
of it, enjoyed the most glorious shower-bath from
the descending spray, that flew up and curled far
overhead, like a snow storm, mingled with ten thousand
miniature rainbows.  I had cooled myself sufficiently,
and was leisurely swimming for the shore.
</p>

<p>
"Now this is what I call bathing," quoth Twig, as
he kept meandering about on the snorting Dare-devil,
who seemed to enjoy the dip as much as his
master&mdash;"I would back this horse against Bucephalus at
swimming."
</p>

<p>
Here Flamingo's steed threw him, by rearing and
pawing the water with his fore legs and sinking his
croup, so that his master, after an unavailing attempt
to mount him again, had to strike out for the beach,
the animal following, and splashing him, as if he
wanted to get on <i>his</i> back by way of a change.
</p>

<p>
"And that's what I call swimming," roared Don
Felix.  But he scarcely had uttered the words when
the horse made at him in earnest, and I thought he
had struck him with the near fore-foot.
</p>

<p>
"And that's what I call drowning," thought I, "or
something deuced like it."
</p>

<p>
However, he was really a good swimmer, and got to
shore safe.
</p>

<p>
Master Twister had been all this time enacting
groom of the stole to the two equestrian bathers, and
so soon as he had arrayed them, we proceeded to the
tavern, dined, and after enjoying a cool bottle of wine,
continued our journey to Ballywindle, which we hoped
to reach shortly after nightfall.
</p>

<p>
The sun was now fast declining; I had shot ahead of
my two cronies and their outriders, I cannot now
recollect why, and we were just entering a grove of
magnificent trees, with their hoary trunks gilded by his
setting effulgence, when Twister's head (he had changed
places with Cousin Teemoty, and was driving me)
suddenly, to my great alarm, gave a sharp crack, as
if it had split open, and a tiny jet of smoke puffed
out of his mouth&mdash;I was all wonder and amazement,
but before I could gather my wits about me, he
jumped from the voiture into the dirty ditch by the
side of the road, and popped his head, ears and all,
below the stagnant green scum, while his limbs, and
all that was seen of him above water, quivered in the
utmost extremity of fear.
</p>

<p>
As soon as Twig and Flamingo came up, I saw that
neither they nor Serjeant Quacco could contain
themselves for laughter.  The latter was scarcely able to
sit his mule&mdash;at length he jumped, or rather tumbled,
oft, and pulled Twister out by the legs; who, the
instant he could stand, and long before he could see for
the mud that filled his eyes, started up the road like
a demoniac, shouting, "Obeah, Obeah!" which so
frightened the sumpter-mule, that he was by this time
alongside of, that she turned and came down, rattling
past us like a whirlwind, until she jammed between
the stems of two of the cocoa-nut trees with a most
furious shock, when lo! the starboard portmanteau she
carried burst and blew up like a shell, and shirts,
trowsers, nightcaps, and handkerchiefs, of all colours,
shapes, and sizes, were shot hither and thither, upwards
and downwards, this side and that, until the
neighbouring trees and bushes were hung with all manner
of garments and streamers, like a pawnbroker's shop.
</p>

<p>
Twig shouted, "There&mdash;that's your share of the
joke, Felix&mdash;there goes your patent portmanteau with
the Bramah lock&mdash;see if the very brimstones in which
you gloried be not streaming like a commodore's broad
pennant from the top of the orange tree.  The green
silk night-cap on the prickly pear&mdash;and the shirts and
the vests, and the real bandanas&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay," shouted Flamingo, who had dismounted
and was endeavouring to catch the mule as she
careered through the wood towards the sea, kicking and
flinging in a vain attempt to disentangle herself from
the other portmanteau, which had now turned under
her belly, and the sumpter-saddle that hung at her
side; "and there goes your kit, Jacob, an offering to
Neptune bodily, mule and all"&mdash;as the poor beast
dashed into the surf, after having threaded through
the stems of the trees without farther damage.
</p>

<p>
The cause of all this was no longer a mystery, for
I had made my guess already; but presently I was
enlightened, if need had been, by friend Quacco.  He
had, it appeared, with Mr Twig's sanction, charged
certain of the pieces of patent tobacco in the <i>spleuchan</i>
with several small quantities of detonating powder,
enclosed in the glass-brittle seeds of the sand-box, as a
trap for Master Twister, who was suspected of
making free with it&mdash;the issue, so far as he was concerned,
has been seen; but in the hurry of coming away and
packing up, instead of placing the bottle containing the
powder in Mr Flamingo's gun-case, where it should
have been, he hurriedly dropped it into his portmanteau,
as Twister was packing it; so that when the
sumpter mule jambed between the trunks of the trees
after it took fright it exploded and blew up.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Massa Twister, you never make free with
my patent tobacco?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, oh, oh!" roared poor Twister, holding his
jaws with both hands&mdash;"Oh, massa, my tongue blow
out&mdash;my palate blow down&mdash;de roof of my mouse blow
up&mdash;and all my teets blow clean gan&mdash;Oh no, massa,
never, never will touch him no more, massa&mdash;never,
never no more."
</p>

<p>
"I'll answer for it you don't, my boy," quoth Jacob.
</p>

<p>
After picking up the fugitive and clambered
garments as well as we could, we travelled onwards for
about two miles, when we struck inland, and as the
night fell entered a dark tree-shaded ravine, with a
brawling brook rushing through the bottom, up which
we threaded our way by a narrow road scarped out of
the red earth of the hill side.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr Brail, give your horse the rein&mdash;let him
pick his own steps, if you please; for the road is
cruelly cut up by the weather and waggons hereabouts, and
none of the widest either, as you may <i>feel</i>, for you can't
see it."
</p>

<p>
I took his advice, and soon found the advantage of
it, as we came to several groups of negroes sitting
invariably on the inner side of the road, which I would
certainly have been tempted to avoid at my own peril;
but my horse was not so scrupulous, for he always poked
his nose between them and the bank, and snorted and
nuzzled until they rose and shuffled out of our way,
either by creeping to the side next the ravine, or up
on the bank; presently the road widened, and we got
along more comfortably.
</p>

<p>
I could not but admire the thousands and tens of
thousands of fire-flies that spangled the gulf below us,
in a tiny galaxy; they did not twinkle promiscuously,
but seemed to emit their small green lights by signal,
beginning at the head of the ravine, and glancing all
the way down in a wavy continuous lambent flash,
every individual fly, as it were, taking the time from
his neighbour ahead.  Then for a moment all would
be dark again, until the stream of sparkles flowed down
once more from the head of the valley, and again
disappeared astern of us; while the usual West India
concert of lizards, beetles, crickets, and tree toads, filled
the dull ear of night with their sleepy monotony.
</p>

<p>
The night soon began to be heavily overcast, and
as we entered below some high wood the darkness
would have become palpable, had it not been for the
fire-flies,&mdash;even darkness which might have been felt.
</p>

<p>
"I must heave to until I get my bat's eyes shipped,
Mr Twig," said I&mdash;"I can't see an inch before my nose."
</p>

<p>
"Then send Flamingo ahead, my dear fellow, for
if he sees the <i>length</i> of <i>his</i> we shall do&mdash;his proboscis
is long enough to give us warning of any impediment."
</p>

<p>
"What a clear glowworm-coloured light some of
these insects do give," quoth I: "See that one
creeping up the handle of my whip&mdash;it comes along with
its two tiny burners, like the lights in a distant
carriage rolling towards you."
</p>

<p>
"Come, you must get on, though, since we have
not room to pass&mdash;no time to study natural philosophy,"
said Twig; and I once more fanned my horse
into a gentle trot, with very much the sensation of one
running through an unknown sound in the night,
without either chart or pilot.
</p>

<p>
After a little, I saw a cluster of <i>red</i> fire-flies, as I
thought, before us.  "Oh, come along, I see now famously."
</p>

<p>
"Oh massa, massa!"&mdash;Crack!&mdash;I had got entangled
with a string of mules going to fetch a last turn of
canes from the field; the red sparks that I had seen
ahead having proceeded from the pipes in the mouths
of the drivers.  However there was no great damage
done.
</p>

<p>
The rain now began to descend in torrents, with a
roar like a cataract.&mdash;"What uncommonly pleasant
weather," thought I.  "Why, Mr Twig, you see I
am a bad pilot&mdash;so, do you think you have room to
pass me now? for, to say the truth, I don't think I can
see a yard of the road, and you know I am an utter
stranger here."
</p>

<p>
He could not pass, however, and at length I had to
set Master Teemoty to lead the horse.  Presently I
heard a splash.
</p>

<p>
"Hilloa, cousin Teemoty! where have you got to?"
</p>

<p>
"De Fairywell no tell lie, massa&mdash;De Devil's Golly,[<a id="chap07fn1text"></a><a href="#chap07fn1">1</a>]
dat has been dry like one bone for tree mont, hab
<i>come down</i>, massa&mdash;dat all."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap07fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap07fn1text">1</a>] Gully&mdash;ravine or river course.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Come <i>down</i>," said I; "I wish it had stayed <i>up</i>!"
</p>

<p>
"Ah!" said Twig,&mdash;"and we are to sleep here in
the cold and damp, I suppose&mdash;the fellow's a fool, and
must have got off the path into some puddle.  We are
a mile from the gully&mdash;let me see"&mdash;and before you
could have turned, Massa Jacob was splashing up to the
knees alongside of Massa Teemoty.  However, he was
right&mdash;it was only a streamlet&mdash;and we got across
without much difficulty; but in ten minutes the roar
of a large torrent, heard hoarse and loud above the
sound of the rain, gave convincing proof that we were
at length approaching the gully&mdash;moreover, that it
was down, and that with a vengeance.  We now
found ourselves amongst a group of negroes, who had
also been stopped by the swollen stream.  There was
a loud thundering noise above us on the left hand,
which (we had now all alighted) absolutely shook the
solid earth under our feet, as if in that direction the
waters had been pitched from the mountain side
headlong over a precipice.  From the same quarter,
although quite calm otherwise, a strong cold wind gushed
in eddies and sudden gusts, as if from a nook or valley
in the hill-side, charged with a thick, wetting spray,
that we could feel curling and boiling about us,
sometimes stronger and sometimes weaker, like the
undulations of a London fog.  Close to our feet we could
hear the river tearing past us, with a great rushing and
gurgling, occasionally intermingled with the rasping
and crashing of trees and floating spars, as they were
dashed along on the gushes and swirls of the stream;
while every now and then the <i>warm</i> water (for so
it felt in contrast with the cold damp night-breeze)
surged a foot or two beyond its usual level, so as to
cover us to the ankle, and make us start back; and
immediately ebb again.  It was some time, amidst this
"groan of rock and roar of stream" before we could
make out any thing that the negroes about us said.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," cried Twig&mdash;to be heard by each other
we had to shout as loud as we could&mdash;"hillo, friend
Felix, here's a coil&mdash;what shall we do&mdash;sleep here, eh?"
</p>

<p>
"We shall sleep soft, then," roared his friend in reply.
</p>

<p>
"As how, my lord?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, you may have mud of all consistencies, and
of any depth."
</p>

<p>
"True, <i>water</i> beds are all the fashion now, and
possibly <i>mud</i> ones might be an improvement; but had
we not better try back," I continued, as I really began
to think it no joke remaining where we were all night.
</p>

<p>
"A good idea," said Twig.
</p>

<p>
"About ship, then," quoth Flamingo.
</p>

<p>
"Wery good plan, wery good plan," shouted Cousin
Teemoty; "but"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"But, but, but&mdash;oh, confound your <i>buts</i>," roared
Twig; "<i>but what</i>, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh," said Tim, whose dignity was a little hurt,
"noting, noting&mdash;no reason why massa should not
return&mdash;only Carrion-crow gully dat we lef behind,
will, by dis time, be twenty time more <i>down</i> as dis,
<i>dat all</i>."
</p>

<p>
"And so it will&mdash;the boy is right," rejoined Jacob;
"What is to be done?  Stop&mdash;I see, I see."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce you do! then you have good eyes,"
quoth Felix.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Flamingo, pick me up a stone that I can
sling, and hold your tongue; do, that's a good fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Sling? where is the Goliah you mean to attack?"
</p>

<p>
"Never you mind, Flam, but pick me up a stone
that I can tie a string to, will ye?&mdash;There, you absurd
creature, you have given me one as round and smooth
as a cricket ball; how can I fasten a string round
<i>it</i>?&mdash;give me a longish one, man&mdash;one shaped like a
kidney-potato or your own nose, you blundering
good-for-nothing&mdash;ah, that will do.  Now, some string,
boys&mdash;string."
</p>

<p>
Every negro carries a string of one kind or another
with him in the crown of his hat, and three or four
black paws were in an instant groping for Jacob Twig's
hand in the dark with pieces of twine.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, what is that?" as an auxiliary-current,
more than ankle deep, began to flow down the road
with a loud ripple from behind us, thus threatening to
cut off our retreat&mdash;"Mind we are not in a scrape
here!" cried I.
</p>

<p>
"If we be, we can't better it," shouted Twig&mdash;"Here,
gentlemen, give me your cards, will ye?'
</p>

<p>
"Cards&mdash;cards!" ejaculated Flamingo and I in a
breath.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;your calling-cards; do grope for them&mdash;make haste."
</p>

<p>
He got the cards, and all was silent except the
turmoil of the elements for a few seconds.  At length,
in a temporary lull of the rain, I thought I heard the
shout of a human voice from the opposite bank,
blending with the roar of the stream.
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay," cried Jacob&mdash;"there, don't you hear
people on the other side?&mdash;so here goes."
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, who the deuce has knocked off my hat?"
cried Flamingo.
</p>

<p>
"Why don't you stand on one side then, or get
yourself shortened by the knees? such a steeple is
always in the way," bawled Twig.  "Leave me scope
to make my cast now, will ye&mdash;don't you <i>see</i> I want
to throw the stone with the cards across amongst the
people on the opposite bank&mdash;There," and he made
another cast&mdash;"ah, I have caught a fish this time&mdash;more
string, Teemoty&mdash;more string&mdash;or they will drag
it out of my hand.  Now some one has got a precious
pelt on the skull with the kidney potato, Felix, as I
am a gentleman; but he understands us, whoever he
may be that has got hold of it&mdash;feel here&mdash;how he
jerks the string without hauling on it&mdash;wait&mdash;wait!"
</p>

<p>
Presently the line was let go at the opposite side,
and our friend hauled it in&mdash;it had been cut short off,
and instead of the stone and cards, a negro clasp knife
was now attached to it.
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;didn't I tell you&mdash;there's a barbarian
telegraph for you&mdash;there's a new invented code of
signals&mdash;now you shall see how my scheme will work,"
cried Jacob.  However, near a quarter of an hour
elapsed without any thing particular occurring, during
which time, we distinctly heard shouting on the other
side, as if to attract our attention, but we could not
make out what was said.
</p>

<p>
At length we observed a red spark, glancing and
disappearing like a will-o'-the-wisp as it zigzagged amongst
the dark bushes, down the hill side above.  Presently
we lost sight of it and all was dark again.  However,
just as I began to lose all hope of the success of Massa
Twig's device, the light again appeared coming steadily
down the road opposite us.  It approached the impassable
ford, and we now saw that it was a lantern carried
by a negro, who was lighting the steps of a short squat
figure of a man, dressed in a fustian coatee and
nankeen trowsers, with an umbrella over his head.  "I've
caught my fish&mdash;I've caught my fish&mdash;Rory Macgregor
himself, or I am a baboon," shouted Twig, as the party
he spoke of came down to the water's edge, and,
holding up the lantern above his head, peered across the
gully with outstretched neck, apparently in a vain
attempt to make us out.
</p>

<p>
By the light we saw a whole crowd of poor, drenched,
stormstaid devils, in their blue pennistone greatcoats,
shivering on the opposite bank.  The white man
appeared to be giving them instructions, as two of them
immediately disappeared up the hill-side, whence he
had descended; while several of the others entered a
watchman's hut that we could observe close to the
waterside, and fetched some wood and dry branches
from it, with which they began to kindle a fire under
a projecting cliff, which soon burned up brightly, and
showed us whereabouts we were.
</p>

<p>
The scene was striking enough.  A quantity of dry
splinters of some kind of resinous wood being heaped
on the fire, it now blazed up brilliantly in massive
tongues of flame, that glanced as they twined up the
fissures, scorching the lichens into sudden blackness, and
licking, like fiery serpents, the tortuous fretwork of
naked roots depending from the trees that grew on the
verge of the bank above, which spread like a net over
the face of the bald grey rock; and lighting up the
fringe of dry fibres depending from the narrow eave
of red earth that projected over the brink of the
precipice, under which the bank appeared white and dusty,
but lower down, where wet by the beating of the rain,
it was red, and glittering with pebbles, as if it had been
the wall of a salt mine in Cheshire.
</p>

<p>
The bright glare, and luminous smoke of the fire,
in which a number of birds, frightened from their
perches, glanced about like sparks, blasted the figures
of such of the negroes as stood beyond it into the
appearance of demons&mdash;little Rory Macgregor looking,
to use his own phrase, like <i>the deil himsell</i>, while those
of them who intervened between us and the fire seemed
magnified into giants&mdash;their dark bodies edged with
red flame; while every tree, and stock, and stone
appeared as if half bronze and half red-hot iron&mdash;a shadock
growing close by, looked as if hung with clusters of
red-hot cannon balls.
</p>

<p>
Our own party was very noticeable.  I was leaning
on the neck of my gig-horse, with his eyes glancing,
and the brazen ornaments of his harness flashing like
burnished gold.  Abreast of me were Massas Twig,
Flamingo, and Cosin Teemoty, wet as <i>muck</i>, and quite
as steamy, to use a genteel phrase, with our cold
drenched physiognomies thrust into the light, and the
sparkling rain-drops hanging at our noses; Jacob's
glazed hat glancing as if his caput had been covered
with a glass porringer; while the group of mounted
negroes and led horses in the background, with the
animals pawing and splashing in the red stream that
ran rippling and twinkling down the road, and the
steam of our rapid travelling rising up like smoke
above them, gave one a very lively idea of a cavalry
picquet on the <i>qui vive</i>.
</p>

<p>
On our larboard hand the mountain ascended precipitously,
in all the glory of magnificent trees, sparkling
with diamond water-drops, stupendous rocks, and all
that sort of thing; with the swollen waters thundering
and chafing, and foaming down a dark deep cleft over
a ledge of stone about thirty feet high, in a solid mass,
which in the descent took a spiral turn, as if it had
been ejected from a tortuous channel above, and then
sending up a thick mist, that rose boiling amongst the
dark trees.  From the foot of this fall the torrent
roared along its overflowing channel in whirling eddies
that sparkled in the firelight, towards where we stood;
the red stream appearing, by some deception of the
sight, to be convex, or higher in the middle than the
sides, and semifluid, as if composed of earth and water;
while trees, and branches, and rolling stones were
launched and trundled along as if borne on a lava
stream.
</p>

<p>
As we looked, the bodies of two bullocks and a mule
came past, rolling over and over, legs, tails, and heads,
in much admired confusion.
</p>

<p>
On the starboard hand the ravine sunk down as dark
as Erebus; and now the weather clearing, disclosed
in that direction, through storm-rents of the heavy
clouds, shreds of translucent blue sky, sparkling with
bright stars; and lo! the fair moon once more!&mdash;her
cold, pale-green light struggling with the hot red glare
of the fire, as she reposed on the fleecy edge of that
dark&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Confound it, what's that&mdash;what's that, Mr Twig?"
</p>

<p>
"An owl, Master Brail&mdash;an owl which the light has
dazzled, and that has flown against your head by
mistake&mdash;but catch, man&mdash;catch"&mdash;as he sprang into the
water up to the knees to secure my hat, that the bird of
Minerva had knocked off&mdash;and be hanged to it.  "An
owl may be a wise bird, but it is a deuced blind one to
bounce against your head as unceremoniously as if it
had been a pumpkin or a calabash."
</p>

<p>
Little Rory Macgregor had all this time remained
at the edge of the stream, squatted on his hams like a
large bull-frog, and apparently, if we could judge from
his action, shouting at the top of his voice; but it was
all dumb show to us, or very nearly so, as we could
not make out one word that he said.
</p>

<p>
Flamingo confronted him, assuming the same
attitude.  "See how he has doubled up his long
legs&mdash;there, now&mdash;said the grasshopper to the frog," quoth
Twig to me.  Here friend Felix made most energetic
signs, a-la Grimaldi, that he wanted some food and
drink.
</p>

<p>
Rory nodded promptly, as much as to say, "I
understand you;" indeed it appeared that he had taken
the hint before, for the two men that we had seen
ascend the mountain-road, now returned; one carrying
a joint of roast meat and a roast fowl, and the other
with a bottle in each hand.
</p>

<p>
The puzzle now was, "how were the good things to
be had across?" but my friends seemed up to every
emergency.  In a moment Flamingo had ascended a
scathed stump that projected a good way over the
gully, with Twig's string and stone in his hand; the
latter enabling him to pitch the line at Rory's feet,
who immediately made the joint of meat fast, which
Don Felix swung across, and untying it, chucked it
down to us who stood below; the fowl, and the rum,
and the bottle of lemonade, or beverage, as it is called
in Jamaica, were secured in like manner.
</p>

<p>
"So," said our ally, "we shan't starve for want of
food, anyhow, whatever we may do of cold."  But we
were nearer being released than we thought; for
suddenly, as if from the giving way of some obstruction
below that had dammed up the water in the gully, it
ebbed nearly two feet, of which we promptly availed
ourselves to pass over to the other side of the Devil's
Gully.  But, notwithstanding, this was a work of no
small difficulty, and even considerable danger.  Being
safely landed, and having thanked Mr Macgregor, who
owned a very fine coffee property in the neighbourhood,
for his kindness, we mounted our vehicles once
more, and drove rapidly out of the defile, now lit by
the moon, and in a quarter of an hour found ourselves
amongst the <i>Works</i>; that is, in the very centre of the
mill-yard of Ballywindle.

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
</h3>

<h4>
MY UNCLE.
</h4>

<p>
Here, late as it was, all was bustle and activity;
the boiling-house was brilliantly lighted up, the clouds
of white luminous vapour steaming through the apertures
in the roof; while the negroes feeding the fires,
sheltered under the stokehole arches from the
weather, and almost smothered amongst heaps of dry
cane-stalks, or trash, as it is called, from which the
juice had been crushed, looked in their glancing
nakedness like fiends, as their dark bodies flitted
between us and the glowing mouths of the furnaces.
A little farther on we came to the two cone-roofed
mill-houses, one of which was put in motion by a
spell of oxen, the other being worked by mules, while
the shouting of the drivers, the cries of the boilermen
to the firemakers to make stronger fires, the crashing
of the canes as they were crushed in the mills, the
groaning and squealing of the machinery, the spanking
of whips, the lumbering and rattling of wains and
waggons, the hot dry axles screaming for grease, and
the loud laugh and song rising occasionally shrill
above the Babel sounds, absolutely confounded me.
</p>

<p>
We stopped at the boiling-house door, and asked
the book-keeper on duty, a tall cadaverous-looking
young man, dressed in a fustian jacket and white
trowsers, who appeared more than half asleep, if the
overseer was at home.  He said he was, and, as we
intended to leave our horses at his house, we turned
their heads towards it, guided by one of the negroes
from the mill.
</p>

<p>
The peep I had of the boiling-house was very
enlivening;&mdash;for, independently of the regular watch
of boiler-negroes, who were ranged beside the large
poppling and roaring coppers, each having a bright
copper laddie, with a long shank like a boathook, in
his hands, it was at this time filled with numbers of
the estate's people, some getting hot liquor, others
sitting against the wall, eating their suppers by the lamp
light, and not a few quizzing and loitering about in
the mist of hot vapour, as if the place had been a
sort of lounge, instead of a busy sugar manufactory&mdash;a
kind of sable <i>soirée</i>.
</p>

<p>
By the time we arrived in front of the overseer's
house, we found the door surrounded by a group of
four patriarchal-looking negroes and an old
respectable-looking negro woman.  The men were clad in
Osnaburg frocks, like those worn by waggoners in
England, with blue frieze jackets over them, and
white trowsers.  The old dame was rigged in a man's
jacket also, over as many garments apparently as worn
by the grave-digger in Hamlet.  I had never seen
such a round ball of a body.  They were all hat-in-hand,
with Madras handkerchiefs bound round their
heads, and leaning on tall staffs made from peeled
young hardwood trees, the roots forming very fantastical
tops.  Their whips were twisted round these
symbols of office, like the snakes round the caduceus
of their tutelary deity, Mercury.  These were the
drivers of the various gangs of negroes on the estate,
who were waiting to receive busha's[<a id="chap08fn1text"></a><a href="#chap08fn1">1</a>] orders for the
morrow.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap08fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap08fn1text">1</a>] The West India name for overseer, or manager of an estate;
a corruption, no doubt, of bashaw.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
On seeing us, the overseer hastily dismissed his
levee, and ordered his people to take charge of our
horses.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Frenche is at home, I hope?" said Mr Twig.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes, sir&mdash;all alone up at the <i>great</i> house
there," pointing to a <i>little</i> shed of a place, perched on
an insulated rocky eminence, to the left of the abode
he himself occupied, which overlooked the works and
whole neighbourhood.
</p>

<p>
This hill, rising as abruptly from the dead level of
the estate as if it had been a rock recently dropped on
it,&mdash;rather a huge areolite, by the way,&mdash;was seen in
strong relief against the sky, now clear of clouds, and
illuminated by the moon.
</p>

<p>
At the easternmost end of the solitary great house&mdash;in
shape like a Chinese pavilion, with a projecting
roof, on a punch bowl, that adhered to the sharp
outline of the hill like a limpet to a rock&mdash;a tall solitary
palm shot up and tossed its wide-spreading, fan-like
leaves in the night wind high into the pure heaven.
The fabric was entirely dark&mdash;not a soul moving
about it&mdash;nothing living in the neighbourhood
apparently, if we except a goat or two moving slowly
along the ridge of the hill.  At the end of the house
next the palm-tree there was a low but steep wooden
stair, with a landing-place at top, surrounded by a
simple wooden railing, so that it looked like a scaffold.
</p>

<p>
"There is Mr Frenche, sir," continued busha, pointing
to the figure of a man lounging in a low chair on
the landing place, with his feet resting on the rail
before him, and far higher than his head, which leant
against the wall of the house, as if he had been a
carronade planted against the opposite hill.  Under the
guidance of one of the overseer's waiting boys, we
commenced the zig-zag ascent towards my uncle's
dwelling, and as we approached, the feeling of
desolateness that pressed on my heart increased, from
the extreme stillness of the place even when near
to it.  Light, or other indication of an inhabited
mansion, there was none&mdash;even the goats had vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Cold comfort in prospect for me," thought I;
"but <i>allons</i>, let us see,"&mdash;and we moved on until we
came to a small outhouse beside a gate, which seemed
to open into the enclosure, in the centre of which
stood the solitary building.
</p>

<p>
"How terribly still every thing is about Mr
Frenche's domicile," said I, as we paused until
Flamingo undid the fastening of the gate.  "And, pray,
what hovel is this that we have come to?"
</p>

<p>
"This?&mdash;Oh, it is the kitchen," quoth Twig.
"Stop, I will knock up the people."
</p>

<p>
"Don't do any such thing," said Flamingo, who, I
saw, was after some vagary.  "Here, Mr Brail, get
up the stair,"&mdash;we had now reached the small
platform on which the house stood,&mdash;"and creep under
his legs, will ye&mdash;there, get into the house and
conceal yourself, and Twig and I will rouse him, and
have some fun before you make your appearance."
</p>

<p>
I gave in to the frolic of the moment, and slipped
silently up the few steps of the steep stair, as I was
desired.  There, on the landing-place, reposed, <i>al
fresco</i>, Uncle Lathom, sure enough&mdash;his chair swung
back, his head resting on the door-post, and his legs
cocked up, as already described, on the outer railing
of the stair.  He was sound asleep, and snoring most
harmoniously; but just as I stole up, and was in the
very act of creeping beneath the yoke to get past him,
I touched his limbs slightly; but the start made him
lose his balance and fall back into the house, and
there I was, like a shrimp in the claws of a lobster,
firmly locked in the embrace of my excellent relative&mdash;for
although his arms were not round my neck, <i>his
legs were</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Who is that, and what is that, and what have I
got hold of now?" roared Uncle Latham, in purest
Tipperary.
</p>

<p>
"It is me, sir," I shouted as loud as I could bellow;
for as we rolled over and over on the head of the
stair, I discovered he had spurs on; but the devil
a bit would he relax in his hold of my neck with his
legs,&mdash;"me, your dutiful nephew, Benjamin Brail&mdash;but,
for goodness sake, mind you have spurs on, uncle."
</p>

<p>
"My nephew&mdash;my nephew, Benjamin Brail, did
you say?&mdash;Oh, murder, fire, and botheration of all
sorts&mdash;spurs, sir?&mdash;spurs?&mdash;Hookey, but I'll find
stronger fare than spurs for you&mdash;You are a robber,
sir&mdash;a robber&mdash;Murphy, you
villain&mdash;Murphy&mdash;Dennis&mdash;Potatoblossom&mdash;bring
me a handsaw, till I cut
his throat&mdash;or a gimblet&mdash;or any other deleterious
eatable&mdash;Oh, you thieves of the world, why don't you
come and help your master?&mdash;Lights, boys&mdash;lights&mdash;hubaboo!"
</p>

<p>
By this I had contrived to wriggle out of my Irish
pillory, and to withdraw my corpus into the house,
where I crept behind a leaf of the door&mdash;any thing
to be out of the row.  I could now hear my uncle
crawling about the dark room like the aforesaid lobster,
disconsolate for the loss of its prey, arguing with
himself aloud whether he were awake, or whether
it was not all a <i>drame</i>, as he called it;&mdash;and then
shouting for his servants at one moment, and
stumbling against the table, or falling rattle over a lot
of chairs, that all seemed to have placed themselves
most provokingly in his way, the next.  During his
soliloquy, I heard Twig and Flamingo's suppressed
laughter at the other end of the room.  At length Mr
Frenche thundered in his gropings against the
sideboard, when such a clash and clang of glasses arose, as
if he had been literally the bull in the china shop.
</p>

<p>
"Ah," he said, "it must be all a drame, and looking
at people drinking, has made me dry&mdash;so let me
wet my whistle a bit&mdash;here's the beverage, so&mdash;now&mdash;ah,
this is the rum bottle&mdash;I know it by the
smell&mdash;and what the devil else should I know it by in the
dark before tasting, I should like to know?&mdash;he! he!&mdash;if
I could but lay my paw on a tumbler now, or a
glass of any kind&mdash;not one to be found, I declare&mdash;Murphy,
you villain, why don't you come when I call
you, sirrah?"&mdash;There was now a concerto of coughing,
and sneezing, and <i>oich, oiching</i>, and yawning, as if
from beneath.&mdash;"Will these lazy rascals never make
their appearance?" continued Mr Frenche,
impatiently&mdash;"Well, I cannot find even a teacup to make some
punch in&mdash;hard enough this in a man's own house,
any how&mdash;but I have the materials&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;now,
for the fun of the thing&mdash;I will mix it Irish fashion&mdash;deuce
take me if I don't," and thereupon I heard him
<i>gurgle, gurgle</i> something out of one bottle&mdash;and then
a long <i>gurgle, gurgle, gurgle</i>, out of another,
apparently, for the gurgling was on different keys,&mdash;both
followed by a long expiration.  He then gave several
jumps on the floor.
</p>

<p>
He had, as I guessed, first swallowed the raw
caulker from the rum decanter, and then sent down the
lemonade to take care of it.  "Now, that rum is very
strong&mdash;stop, let me qualify it a bit with some more
beverage&mdash;how thirsty I am, to be sure&mdash;murder!&mdash;confound
that wide-necked decanter."  Here I could
hear the liquid splash all over him.  "There&mdash;so much
for having a beautiful small mouth&mdash;why, Rory Macgregor,
with that hole in his face from ear to ear, would
have drunk you the whole bottle without spilling a
drop, and here am I, suffocated and drowned entirely,
and as wet as if I had been dragged through the Bog
of Allan&mdash;Murphy, you scoundrel?"
</p>

<p>
Anon, two negro servants, stretching and yawning,
each with a candle in his hand, made their appearance,
one in his shirt, with his livery coat hanging over his
head, the cape projecting forward, and a sleeve
hanging down on each side; the other had his coat on
certainly, but stern foremost, and not another rag of
any kind or description whatever, saving and
excepting his Kilmarnock nightcap.
</p>

<p>
By the illumination which those ebony candlesticks
furnished, I now could see about me.  The room we
were in was about twenty feet square, panelled, ceiled,
and floored&mdash;it looked like a large box&mdash;with unpainted,
but highly-polished hard-wood, of the colour of
very old mahogany&mdash;handsomer than any oak panelling
I had ever seen.  There was a folding door that
communicated with the front piazza, out of which we
had scrambled&mdash;-another, that opened into a kind of
back dining-hall, or large porch, and two on each hand,
which opened into bedrooms.  A sideboard was placed
by the wall to the right, between the two bedroom
doors, at which stood a tall and very handsome elderly
gentleman, who, if I had not instantly known to be
my uncle, from his likeness to my poor mother, I
might, after the adventures of the day, and the
oddities of <i>messieurs</i> my friends&mdash;<i>the</i> Twig of the Dream,
and the Flamingo of Peaweep, Snipe, and Flamingo&mdash;have
suspected some quiz or practical joke in the matter.
</p>

<p>
The gentleman, evidently not broad awake yet, was
dressed in light-coloured kerseymere small-clothes,
top-boots, white vest, and blue coat&mdash;he was very bald,
with the exception of two tufts of jet-black hair behind
his ears, blending into very bushy whiskers.  His
forehead was round and beetling&mdash;you would have said he
was somewhat bullet-headed; had the obduracy of the
feature not been redeemed by his eyebrows, which were
thick, well arched, and, like his hair and whiskers,
jet-black&mdash;and also by his genuine Irish sparklers, dark,
flashing, and frolicsome.
</p>

<p>
His complexion was of the clearest I had seen in
Jamaica&mdash;I could never have guessed that he had been
above a few weeks from the "First gem of the Sea,"&mdash;and
his features generally large and well formed.  There
was a playful opening of the lips every now and then,
disclosing nice ivory teeth, and evincing, like his eyes,
the native humour of his country.
</p>

<p>
"So, Master Murphy, you are there at last," said he.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, massa&mdash;yes, massa."
</p>

<p>
"Pray, can you tell me, Murphy, if any one has
arrived here&mdash;any stranger come into the house while
I slept;" then <i>aside</i>, as the players say, "or has it
really and truly been all a <i>drame</i>?"
</p>

<p>
"No see noting, massa&mdash;nor nobody"&mdash;[<i>yawn</i>.]
</p>

<p>
"You didn't, oh&mdash;there, do you see any thing now?"
said my uncle&mdash;as he took the candle out of the black
paw, and put the lighted end, with all the composure
in life, into Murphy's open mouth, where it shone
through his cheeks like a rushlight in a winter turnip,
until it burned the poor fellow, and he started back,
overturning his sleepy coadjutor, Dennis, headlong on
the floor.  On which signal, Twig and Flamingo,
who were all this time coiled up like two baboons
below the sideboard, choking with laughter, caught
Uncle Frenche by the legs, a limb a piece, who
thereupon set up a regular howl&mdash;"ach, murder! murder! it
is abducted, and ravished, and married
against my will I shall be&mdash;murder!"&mdash;as <i>he</i> in turn
capsized over the prostrate negroes, and all was
confusion and vociferation once more&mdash;until my two
travelling friends, who had cleverly slipped out of the <i>mêlée</i>,
while my uncle was clapperclawing with his
serving-men, returned from the pantry, whither they had
betaken themselves; and now stood on the original
field of battle, the landing-place of the stair, each with
a lighted candle in his hand, and making believe to be
in great amazement at the scene before them.
</p>

<p>
"Heyday," quoth Twig, "what's the matter, Master
Frenche?&mdash;what uproar is this in the house?&mdash;we
heard it at the Devil's Gully, two miles off, believe me."
</p>

<p>
"Uproar?" shouted Uncle Lathom, still sitting
on the floor, scratching his poll&mdash;"uproar, were you
pleased to say?&mdash;pray, who the mischief are you,
gentlemen, who conceive yourselves privileged to speak
of any little noise I choose to make in my own house?&mdash;tell
me in an instant, or by the powers I will shoot
you for a brace of robbers"&mdash;clapping the lemonade
decanter, which had all this time escaped by a miracle,
to his shoulder, blunderbuss fashion.
</p>

<p>
Here gradually slewing himself round on his tail,
and rubbing his eyes, he at length confronted me, as I
sat coiled up behind the leaf of the door&mdash;"Why,
<i>here</i> is a second edition of my drame."  The very
absurd expression of face with which he said this, and
regarded me, fairly upset my gravity, already heavily
taxed, and losing all control, I laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"Another of them! and who <i>may you be</i>, young
gentleman?&mdash;<i>you</i> seem to find yourself at home, at
any rate, I think."
</p>

<p>
"Come, come," said Flamingo&mdash;"enough of this
nonsense&mdash;don't you know your friends Twig and
Flamingo, Mr Frenche?"
</p>

<p>
"Twig and Flamingo, did you say?&mdash;Twig and
Flamingo&mdash;Twig&mdash;oh dear, oh dear&mdash;it is no drame
after all&mdash;my dear fellows, how are you?&mdash;why, what
a reception I have given you&mdash;you must have thought
me mad?"  By this time he had got on his legs again,
and was welcoming my fellow-travellers with great
cordiality, which gave me time to resume the perpendicular
also.  "I am so glad to see you&mdash;why, Jacob, I
did not look for you until Tuesday next, but you are
the welcomer, my good boy&mdash;most heartily welcome&mdash;how
wet you must have got, though&mdash;boys, get
supper&mdash;Felix, I am so rejoiced to see you&mdash;supper,
you villains&mdash;why, we shall have a night on't, my lads."
</p>

<p>
"Give me leave to introduce this young gentleman
to you first," said Twig, very gravely, leading
me forward into the light, "your nephew, Mr
Benjamin Brail."
</p>

<p>
"My nephew!" quoth Mr Frenche&mdash;"why, there's
my drame again&mdash;my nephew!&mdash;when did he arrive?"&mdash;here
he held a candle close to my face, as if my
nose had been a candle-wick, and he meant to light
it; then fumbling in his bosom with the other hand,
he drew forth a miniature of my mother&mdash;"my
nephew!&mdash;my poor sister's boy, Benjie!&mdash;as like her as
possible, I declare&mdash;how are you, Benjamin?&mdash;oh,
Benjie, I am rejoiced to see you&mdash;my heart is full,
full&mdash;how are"&mdash;&mdash;And as the tear glistened in his
eye, he made as if he would have taken me in his
arms, when a sudden light seemed to flash on him,
and he turned sharply round to Twig&mdash;"If you are
playing me a trick here, Jacob; if you are trifling
with the old man's feelings, and allowing his dearest
wish on earth to lead his imagination to deceive him
in this matter"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Twig held out his hand; I could notice that the
kind-hearted fellow's own eye was moist.  "You
cannot seriously believe me capable of such heartless
conduct, Mr Frenche, with all my absurdities; believe
me, I would sooner cut off this right hand than play
with the kindly feelings or affections of any one, far
less with those of my long-tried and highly-esteemed
friend;" and he shook my uncle's proffered paw warmly
as he spoke.
</p>

<p>
"Tol, lol, de roll&mdash;Murphy, Dennis&mdash;supper, you
villains&mdash;supper&mdash;Benjie, my darling, kiss me, my
boy&mdash;I am so happy&mdash;tol de roll"&mdash;here, in his joy
and dancing, he struck his toe sharply against the leg
of a table; and as it was the member from whence the
gout had been but recently dislodged, the pain made
him change his tune with a vengeance; so he caught
hold of the extremity in one hand, and pirouetted, with
my assistance, to an arm-chair.  But we were all tired;
therefore, suffice it to say, that we had an excellent
meal, and a drop of capital <i>hot</i> whisky-punch&mdash;a rare
luxury in Jamaica&mdash;and were soon all happy and
snoozing in our comfortable beds.
</p>

<p>
The first thing I heard next morning, before I got
out of bed, was Mr Rory Macgregor, the Samaritan to
whom our cards had been carried the night before,
squealing about the house in his strong Celtic accent,
for he spoke as broad as he did the day he first left
home, some twenty years before.  He was too proud,
I presume, to be obliged to the <i>Englishers</i>, as he
called them, even for a dash of their lingo.  He had
come to invite us to dine with him on the following
day; and the fame of my arrival having spread, a
number of the neighbours also paid their respects
during the forenoon, so that my levee was larger than
many a German prince's.
</p>

<p>
Mr Macgregor, and the overseer of the neighbouring
estate, remained that day to dinner; the latter
was also a Scotchman, a Lowlander, and although I
always resist first impressions when they are unfavourable,
still there was something about him that I did
not like.  I felt a sort of innate antipathy towards him.
</p>

<p>
From what I was told, and indeed, from what I saw,
I knew that he was a well-connected and a well-educated
man, and both by birth and education far above
the status of an overseer on a sugar estate in Jamaica;
but he had bent himself, and stooped to his condition,
instead of dignifying by his conduct an honest although
humble calling.
</p>

<p>
His manners had grown coarse and familiar; and
after dinner, when we were taking our wine, and
Flamingo and Twig were drawing out little Roderick,
much to our entertainment, this youth chose to bring
the subject of religion on the table, in some way or
other I cannot well tell how.  My uncle, I think, had
asked him if he had attended the consecration of the
new church or chapel, and he had made a rough and
indecent answer, expressing his thankfulness to
<i>Heaven!</i> that he was above all bigotry, and had never
been in a church, except at a funeral, since he had left
Scotland.  He was instantly checked by Mr Frenche,
who was unexpectedly warm on the subject; but it
seems this was not the first time he had offended in a
similar way; so I was startled, and not a little pleased
at the <i>dressing</i> he now received at the hands of my
usually good-natured uncle.
</p>

<p>
"Young gentleman," said he, with a gravity that I
was altogether unprepared for, "you compel me to do
a thing I abhor at any time, especially in my own
house, and that is to touch on sacred subjects at
untimely seasons; but this is not the first time you have
offended under this roof, and I therefore am driven to
tell you once for all, that I never will allow any
sneering at sacred subjects at my table.  I just now asked
you a simple and a civil question, and you have returned
me a most indecent and unchristian answer."
</p>

<p>
"Christian&mdash;Christian!" exclaimed the overseer;
"you believe in those things, I suppose?"
</p>

<p>
"I believe my Bible, sir," rejoined my uncle, "as I
hope you do?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" said the overseer, "Mr Frenche has turned
Methodist," and burst into a vulgar laugh.
</p>

<p>
He had gone too far, however.  My uncle at this
rose, and for several seconds looked so witheringly at
him, that, with all his effrontery, I could perceive his
self-possession evaporating rapidly.
</p>

<p>
"Methodist, sir&mdash;Methodist I am none, unless to
believe in the religion of my fathers be Methodism.
Heaven knows, whatever my belief may be, my practice
is little akin to what theirs was; but let me tell
you, once for all, although I am ever reluctant to
cast national reflections, it is your young Scotchmen,
who, whatever they may have been in their own country,
and theirs we all know to be a highly religious
and moral one, become, when left to themselves in
Jamaica, beyond all comparison, the most irreligious
of the whole community.  How this comes about I
cannot tell; but I see, young man, false modesty has
overlaid your better sense, and made you ashamed of
what should have been your glory to avow, as it will
assuredly be one day your greatest consolation, if you
are a reasonable being, when you come to die.  At all
events, if you do not believe what you have so
improperly endeavoured to make a jest of, I <i>pity</i> you.  If
you do believe, and yet so speak, I <i>despise</i> you; and I
recommend you hereafter, instead of blushing to avow
the Christian principles that I know were early
instilled into your mind, to blush at your conduct,
whenever it is such as we have just witnessed; but let
us change the subject.  I say, Benjie, let us have a
touch of politics&mdash;politics."
</p>

<p>
Here the kind-hearted old man's anxiety to smooth
the downfall of the sulky young Scotchman was so
apparent, that we all lent a hand to help him to gather
way on the other tack; but our Scotch friend could
not stomach being shown up, or put down, whichever
you may call it, so peremptorily; and the first dinner
I ate in mine uncle's house was any thing but a pleasant one.
</p>

<p>
According to previous arrangement, we had the
whole of the next forenoon to ourselves.  Many a
long and kindly family yarn was spun between us;
but as this is all parish news, I will not weary the
reader with it, simply contenting myself with stating,
that, before we began to prepare for our ride, I had
more reason than ever to be grateful to my dear uncle.
</p>

<p>
At two o'clock we mounted our horses, and set out,
accompanied by Messrs Twig and Flamingo, to dine
with our Highland friend, Roderick Macgregor, Esq.
We rode along the <i>interval</i> or passage between two
large cane-pieces, the richest on the estate, which
was situated in a dead level, surrounded by low limestone
hills.  By the way, the locality of Ballywindle was
very peculiar, and merits a word or two as we scull along.
Stop, and I will paint it to the comprehension of all the
world, as thus&mdash;Take a punch bowl, or any other vessel
you choose approaching to the same shape, and fill it
half full of black mould; pop three or four lumps of
sugar into the centre, so that they may stick on the
surface of the mould, without sinking above a half of
their diameter.  They are the works, boiling-house,
still-house, trash-houses, and mill-houses.  Then drop
a large lump a little on one side, and balance a very
tiny one on the top of it, and you have the small
insulated hill on which the great house stands.  As for
the edges of the vessel, they are the limestone hills,
surrounding the small circular valley, the faces of
them being covered with Guinea grass pieces, sprinkled
with orange and other fruit-trees; both grass and
trees finding their sustenance of black earth, as they
best may, amongst the clefts of the honey-combed
limestone that crops out in all directions, of which
indeed the hills are entirely composed, without any
continuous superstratum of earth whatever.  You see the
place now, I suppose?  Well, but to make it plainer
still&mdash;take a sheet of paper, and <i>crumple</i> it in your
hand; then throw it on the table, and you have a good
idea of one of those hills, and not a bad one of the
general surface of the island taken as a whole.
</p>

<p>
The ridges of the hills were in this case covered
with high wood.  So now let us get hold of our yarn
once more.  The field on the right hand, from a large
sink-hole, as it is called, or aperture in the centre&mdash;I
love to be particular&mdash;was called "Tom's Pot," and
the cane patch on the left, "Mammy Polder's Bottom."
</p>

<p>
I found that a level cane-piece, in such a situation,
was always called a <i>Bottom</i>.  Again, as for those
sink-holes, or caverns in the rock, I can compare them, from
their sinuosities, to nothing more aptly than the
human ear.  They generally seem to be placed in
situations where they answer the purpose of natural drains
to carry off the water; the one in question, for instance,
always receiving the drainings of the little valley, and
never filling; having a communication, beyond doubt,
with some of the numberless streamlets, gullies, or
small rivers (hence such natural syphons as the Fairywell),
that cross one's path at every turn in this "land
of streams," as the name Jamaica imports in the Charib
tongue, as I have heard say.
</p>

<p>
The canes grew on each side of the interval, to the
height of eighteen or twenty feet; but as they did not
arch overhead, they afforded no shelter from the sun,
although they prevented the breeze reaching us, and
it was in consequence most consumedly hot.
</p>

<p>
"Now for a cigar to <i>cool</i> one," quoth Twig, chipping
away, cigar in mouth, with his small flint and
steel, as we began to ascend the narrow corkscrew path
that spiralled through the rocky grass-piece bounding
the cane fields.
</p>

<p>
After we had zigzagged for a quarter of an hour on
the face of the hill, we attained the breezy summit,
where the guinea grass-piece ended, and entered,
beneath the high wood, on a narrow bridle-path, that
presently led us through a guava plantation, the trees
heavily laden with the fruit, which makes a capital
preserve, but is far from nice to eat raw.  It is
in shape and colour somewhat like a small yellow
pippin, with a reddish pulp, and the flavour being rather
captivating, I had demolished two or three, when
Flamingo picked two very fine ones, and shortened sail
until I ranged alongside of him.  He then deliberately
broke first the one and then the other, and held up the
halves to me; they were both full of worms.
</p>

<p>
"Dangerous for cattle," quoth Don Felix, dryly.
</p>

<p>
"Come, that is rough wit, Flamingo," chimed in
Twig.  "But never mind, Mr Brail.  Cows <i>do</i> die of
bots sometimes hereabouts, after trespassing; but then
you know they also die of a surfeit of wet clover.  At
all events, there is nothing bucolical about you."
</p>

<p>
"Bots," thought I; "how remarkably genteel and
comfortable, and what an uncommonly delicate fruit
for a dessert."
</p>

<p>
Leaving the guava jungle, we proceeded through a
district that seemed to have once been in cultivation,
as all the high timber, with the exception of a solitary
mahogany or cedar here and there, was cut down, and
there was nothing to be seen but a thicket of palma
Christi, or castor oil bushes, on every side.  There
had apparently been some heavy showers on this table
land during the time we had been winding up the hill,
as the bushes and long grass were sparkling brilliantly
with rain-drops, and the ground was heavily saturated
with water.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, Twig, my darling," sung out uncle Lathom,
who was the sternmost of all, except the servants,
as we <i>strung</i> along the narrow path in single file
"mind you take the road to the right there&mdash;it will
save us a mile."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir," returned he of the Dream.
</p>

<p>
Master Flamingo, who was between him and me,
was busy at this moment with his fowling-piece, that
he carried in his hand; the fame of abundance of teal
and quails in the Macgregor's neighbourhood having
reached him before starting.
</p>

<p>
"What a very beautiful bird that is, Mr Brail," here
he pointed with the gun to the huge branch of a cotton
tree that crossed the path overhead, where a large
parrot was perched, looking at us; one moment scratching
its beak with its claws, and the next, peeping
knowingly down, and slewing its head first to one side
and then to the other&mdash;a parrot, amongst the feathered
tribes, being unquestionably what a monkey is amongst
quadrupeds.
</p>

<p>
"I should like to bring that chap down now," said
Flam, stopping in his career, and damming us up in
the narrow path, whereby we all became clustered in a
group about him; then suiting the action to the word,
he, without any farther warning, dropped the rein into
the hollow of his arm, and taking aim, let drive&mdash;and
away went the whole party helter skelter at the report,
in every direction, by a beautiful centrifugal movement.
If we had been rockets disposed like the spokes of a
cart-wheel, with the matches converging to a centre,
and fired all at once, we could scarcely have radiated
more suddenly.  It was quite surprising the precision
with which we flew crashing through the wet bushes,
some of us nearly unhorsed amongst them, if the truth
were known:&mdash;and such shouting from whites and
blacks, and uproarious laughter, as we all got once more
into sailing order!
</p>

<p>
"Now, friend Felix," said Twig, as he and his horse
emerged from the brushwood, with his pale yellow nankeens
as dark with moisture as a wet sail, his shirt frill
and collar as if the garment had been donned fresh from
the washing-tub, and with the large silvery globules
of moisture as thickly clustered on the black silk frogs
of his coat as diamonds on the Dowager Lady Castlereagh's
stomacher&mdash;there's a simile for you,&mdash;"now,
friend Felix&mdash;give one some notice next time you
begin your fusilade, if you please.  Why, did you ever
see a pulk of Cossacks on a forage, Mr Frenche?&mdash;I
declare I am glad to find myself on the beaten
path again, for my horse took so many turns that I
was fairly dumfounded, and having no pocket-compass
nor a sextant to take the sun by&mdash;you perceive I have
been at sea, Master Brail&mdash;I thought I should have
been lost entirely, until you should have been piloted
to me some days hence by the John Crows.  But ah,
ye little fishes, what is that&mdash;what <i>is</i> that?"
</p>

<p>
It was neither more nor less than the sound of an
ill-blown, yelling and grunting bagpipe.  We rode on&mdash;the
diabolical instrument squealing louder and louder&mdash;until
the path ended in a cleared space amidst the
brushwood, with a small one-story <i>wattled</i> house in
the centre, having a little piazza in front, with a yard
or two at each end, shut in with wooden blinds, sadly
bleached by the weather.  There was a group of
half-naked negroes squatting before it, and a number of
little naked black children, and a sprinkling of brown
ones, running about, and puddling in a dirty pond,
amongst innumerable ducks, fowls of many kinds, and
at least a dozen pigs.  "No signs of any approach to
famine in the land at all events," thought I.
</p>

<p>
There was no rail or fence of any kind enclosing
this building, which, to all appearance, was neither
more nor less than a superior kind of negro-house.  It
stood on the very edge&mdash;indeed was overshadowed
by some gigantic trees (beneath whose Babylonish
dimensions it shrank to a dog-kennel) of the high
natural forest, a magnificent vista through which
opened right behind it, overarching a broken up and
deeply rutted road, the path, apparently, through
which some heavy timber had been drawn, it being
part of Rory's trade to prepare mill-rollers and other
large pieces of hard-wood required for the estates
below.
</p>

<p>
In front of this shed&mdash;full fig, in regular Highland
costume, philabeg, short hose, green coatee, bonnet
and feather&mdash;marched the bagpiper, whose strains had
surprised us so much, blowing his instrument, and
strutting and swelling like a turkey-cock, to some
most barbarous mixture of "a gathering of the clans,"
and the negro tune of "Guinea corn, I love for nyam you."
</p>

<p>
The fellow was a negro, and as black as the ace of
spades&mdash;shade of Ossian, let thy departed heroes
hereafter recline on clouds of tobacco smoke&mdash;and as we
approached he "loud and louder blew," to the great
discomfiture of our whole party, as the animals we
bestrode seemed to like the "chanter" as little as
they had done the report of Flamingo's gun, one and all
resolutely refusing, as if by common consent, to face
the performer&mdash;so there we were, jammed, snorting,
and funking, and splashing each other to the eyes
with mud of the complexion and consistency of <i>peas
brose</i>, in the narrow path; Twig and I, the head of
the column, as it were, being the only individuals
visible on the fringe of the brushwood.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Rory&mdash;Rory Macgregor," shouted Twig,
"do give over&mdash;do tell your black bagpiper to have
done with his most infernal noise, and be hanged to
him&mdash;or we must all go home again without our
dinner&mdash;none of our horses will <i>debouche</i> in the face of
such a salutation, don't you see?"
</p>

<p>
"Ou ay, ou ay," rejoined Rory, emerging from the
house himself, also dressed, like his man, in full
Highland costume&mdash;and having desired the piper in <i>Gaelic</i>,
with the air of the hundredth and fiftieth cousin to
"her Grace the Tuke," to cease <i>her bumming</i>, he
marshalled us into the house, evidently in no small
surprise that any breathing creature whatever, biped
or quadruped, should have any the smallest objections
to the "music of the <i>cods</i>."
</p>

<p>
The bagpiper, we found afterwards, was his servant,
whom he had taken to Scotland with him two years
before, and polished him there, through the
instrumentality of a Highland Serjeant, to the brilliancy we
had witnessed.  However, let me be honest&mdash;he
received us with the most superabundant kindness; and
when we had retired into the inner part of the house,
which was his dining-hall, he gave the word for dinner,
and, every thing considered, the set out was
exceedingly good&mdash;we had a noble pea-fowl&mdash;and, as if that
had not been sufficient, a young turkey also&mdash;a capital
round of beef&mdash;a beautiful small joint of mutton;
excellent mountain mullet; a dish of Cray-fish; and a
small sort of fresh-water lobster, three or four times
bigger than a large prawn, which are found in great
plenty below the stones in the Jamaica mountain
streams&mdash;black or land crabs, wild-duck, and wild
Guinea fowl, and a parrot-pie&mdash;only fancy a
parrot-pie!&mdash;wild pigeons, and I don't know what all
besides&mdash;in truth, a feast for six times our number&mdash;but in
the opinion of our host, there appeared to be something
wanting still.
</p>

<p>
"Tuncan," this was our friend the musician, who
had laid down his instrument to officiate as
butler&mdash;"Tuncan, whar hae ye stowed tae hackis&mdash;whar
hae ye stowed tae hackis, man?&mdash;a Heeland shentleman's
tinner is nae tinner ava without tae hackis!"
</p>

<p>
"Me no know, massa," quoth the Celtic <i>neger</i>.
</p>

<p>
"You ton't know&mdash;ten you pehuvet to know, sir&mdash;Maister
Frenche, shall I help you to a <i>spaul</i> of tae
peacock hen?&mdash;Maister Flamingo, will you oplige me
py cutting up tae turkey polt?"
</p>

<p>
"All the pleasure in life&mdash;whew!&mdash;what is this?"
as a cloud of fragrant vapour gushed from the plump
breast of the bird.
</p>

<p>
"As I am a shentleman, if tae prute peast of a
cook has na stuffet tae turkey polt we tae hackis&mdash;as
I am a shentleman!"
</p>

<p>
"And what is this, then," said Dr Tozy, a
neighbouring surgeon, who was one of the party&mdash;and a
most <i>comfortable</i> looking personage in every sense of
the word, as a dish, containing the veritable haggis to
all appearance, was handed over his shoulder and placed
on the table.  "A deuced good-looking affair it is, I
declare," looking at it through his eyeglass&mdash;"here is
the real haggis, Master Macgregor, here it is."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, so it is&mdash;so it is"&mdash;quoth Rory, rubbing his
hands.  "Here, poy&mdash;here, Tuncan&mdash;pring it here&mdash;let
me cut it up mysell&mdash;let me cut it mysell."
</p>

<p>
It was accordingly placed before Rory, who, all
impatience, plunged his knife into it&mdash;murder, what a
<i>hautgout</i>, and no wonder; for it actually proved to
be a guava pudding, that the drunken cook had stuffed
into the sheep's stomach!
</p>

<p>
However, we had all a good laugh, doing great
honour, notwithstanding, to an excellent dinner; and
when we began to enjoy ourselves over our wine, Dr
Tozy and Twig, aided and abetted by Flamingo, amused
us exceedingly by the fun they extracted from our
friend Rory.
</p>

<p>
Mr Macgregor not being quite so polished a
gentleman as his Majesty George IV., had been rather
particular, shortly after this, in his notice of Mr Twig's
coat&mdash;the colour of which some how did not please him.
</p>

<p>
"Noo, I taresay, Maister Twick, you ca' that plue&mdash;a
plue coat&mdash;put I think it mair plack tan plue."
</p>

<p>
"Why, Mac, you are not so far wrong, it is more
black than blue."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, so I thought," quoth Rory.
</p>

<p>
"And I'll give you the reason, if you promise not
to tell," said Twig.  "It is the first trial piece of my
new patent cloth."
</p>

<p>
"Your patent cloth!" whispered the last of the
Goths, "have <i>you</i> a patent for cloth."
</p>

<p>
"To be sure I have&mdash;that never loses the colour,
and is as impervious to wet as a lawyer's wig, or a
duck's wing."
</p>

<p>
"It al no pe a Mackintosh, will it?"
</p>

<p>
"Mackintosh!" exclaimed his jovial friend&mdash;"Mackintosh!&mdash;why
Charley cannot hold the candle to me&mdash;no,
no, it is the first spun out of&mdash;here lend me your
lugs," and he laid hold of the Highland man's ear, so
as to draw his head half across the table in a most
ludicrous fashion.  "It is made entirely out of negro
wool."
</p>

<p>
"Necroo wool?" rejoined Rory, lying back in his
chair, holding up his hands, and looking to the roof,
with a most absurd expression of face, half credulous,
half doubting&mdash;"wool from tae veritable neger's heads,
tid you say?"
</p>

<p>
"Negro-head wool, Rory, every fibre of it.  The
last bale I sent home was entirely composed of the
autumn shearing of my own people at the Dream&mdash;I
sent it to some manufacturing friends of mine in
Halifax"&mdash;and, holding out his sleeve&mdash;"there, the Duke
of Devonshire patronises it, I assure ye&mdash;nothing else
will go down next season at Almack's."
</p>

<p>
"Allmac's?" exclaimed Rory, "to you mean to say
it will shoopersede tae forty-second tartan?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, and ninety-second too.  However, I find it
will not take on indigo freely, in consequence of the
essential oil."
</p>

<p>
"Oil!" said Rory; "creeshy prutes."
</p>

<p>
"So, in consequence, I intend after this to confine
the manufacture to <i>black</i> cloth, which will require no
dye you know; if you choose to contract, Rory, I will
give you half-a-crown per pound for all you can deliver
during the next year&mdash;or threepence a-fleece&mdash;<i>head</i>, I
mean&mdash;and that is the top of the market for Spanish
wool&mdash;but it must be clean&mdash;free of&mdash;you understand?"
</p>

<p>
By this time I perceived that Dr Tozy and Flamingo
were both literati in a small way, whereby one or two
amusing mistakes took place on the part of Master
Rory Macgregor, who, of all points of the compass,
had no pretensions to any kind or description of
erudition.
</p>

<p>
The conversation happened to turn on Irish politics,
and Mr Frenche had just remarked that, notwithstanding
all the noise and smoke of the demagogues
who lived and battened on the disturbances of the
country, he believed on his conscience, from what he
saw, when he was last in Ireland, that there were very
few influential men of respectability or property who
countenanced them or their doings.
</p>

<p>
"Yet, strange as it does appear, there are some,
uncle," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, undoubtedly," exclaimed Tozy, an Irishman
himself; "but very few&mdash;very few indeed&mdash;mere
drops in the bucket&mdash;<i>rari nantes in gurgite vasto</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Fat's tat, toctor?&mdash;is tat Creek?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; it means capital brandy for a long drink,"
said Tozy, swigging off his glass of cold brandy grog
as coolly as possible.
</p>

<p>
"What an expressive language!&mdash;maist as much
sae as tae Gaelic.  To you know, py the very soond,
I guessed it was something apoot pranty and a long
trink?" quoth Rory.
</p>

<p>
"You shine to-day, doctor," said Twig; but
presently Flamingo flew off with the thread of the
conversation, like a magpie stealing twine, and I forget
the prominent topics we discussed, but we had a great
deal of fun and laughter, until Don Felix once more
settled down in some literary talk with Tozy, and
incidentally noticed the Decameron of Boccaccio.
</p>

<p>
Rory, unfortunate Rory, once more pricked up his
ears at this, and determined to show his conversational
powers now, if he had been interrupted before,
being by this time also a little in the wind.  So, after
grunting to himself, "Cameron&mdash;Cameron," he, after a
moment's thought, perked himself up in his chair and
swore stoutly that he knew <i>him</i> very well&mdash;"as fine
a chiel as ever pore the name of Cameron, and her
place was ane of tae finest in the west coast of
Arkyleshire&mdash;na, am no shust shure put she may pe a farawa'
cousin of Lochiel's hersell."
</p>

<p>
"The very same," quoth Twig, trotting away
with the Macgregor, as if he had got him on one
of his own <i>shelties</i>, and entering on a long rambling
conversation, during which he took care to butter him
an inch thick&mdash;"Why, you do make the shrewdest
remarks, Mac; shrewd! nay, the wisest, I should say.
You really know <i>every thing</i> and <i>every body</i>&mdash;you are
a perfect Solon."
</p>

<p>
Flamingo here saw, and so did I, that Macgregor&mdash;whether
he began to feel that Jacob was quizzing him
or not, I could not tell&mdash;looked as black as thunder,
so he good-humouredly struck in with&mdash;"Now, Jacob,
do hold your tongue, you are such a chatterbox!"
</p>

<p>
"Chatterbox!&mdash;to be sure&mdash;I can't help it.  I have
dined on parrot-pie, you know, Felix."
</p>

<p>
"I wish tae hat peen hoolets for your sake, Maister
Twick," said Roderick, fiercely.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Rory, why?  An owl-pie would not quite
suit my complexion.&mdash;But, hang it, man, what is
wrong?  Judging from your own physiog, one might
suppose you had been making your dinner on the bird
of Minerva yourself."
</p>

<p>
"Maister Twick," said Rory, with a face as sour as
vinegar, "I am unwilling to pe uncivil in my own
house;&mdash;but I red you no to pe sae free wi' your
nicknames."
</p>

<p>
"Nicknames!" interjected Twig, in great surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir&mdash;you have taken tae unwarrantaple liperty
of calling me a Solan&mdash;yes, sir, a Solan.&mdash;Tid
you mean it offensively, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"No offence, Mac," shouted Twig, "none in the
least.&mdash;Offence!&mdash;in likening you to Solon, the glory
of Greece&mdash;the great lawgiver&mdash;the <i>Athenian</i> Solon!"
</p>

<p>
Rory grew frantic at this (as he thought) additional
insult.&mdash;"Creese&mdash;Creese!&mdash;I ken o' nae Solans, sir,
put tae filthy ill-faured pirds tat leeve in tae water."
</p>

<p>
"But Rory, my dear fellow"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Ton't tear fellow me, sir.&mdash;You may ca' them
what ye like, sir, in <i>Creese</i>&mdash;but a Solan at tae Craik
of Ailsa[<a id="chap08fn2text"></a><a href="#chap08fn2">2</a>] is ca'd a cuse, sir, an' naething else, I ken
tat, sir, I ken tat; and if ony shentlemans will tare to
liken Roterick Macgregor to sic an ill-flavoured pird,
sir, py"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap08fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap08fn2text">2</a>] A remarkable insulated rock in the frith of Clyde, famous
for its solan geese, from which (the rock, not the geese) the
Marquis of Ailsa takes his title.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"I assure you, upon my honour, I said Solon, and
not Solan, Mac," quoth Twig.  "There, ask Tozy.&mdash;You
know I would not say an uncivil thing to you,
Rory, for the world."
</p>

<p>
We were like to expire with laughter at this, but
the Celt was pacified at length, through the good
offices of the doctor, and we all held on in good
fellowship.  But as the evening wore away, the musquittoes
began to be very troublesome, as we could <i>feel</i>
ourselves, and <i>hear</i>, if we had not felt, from their loud
buzzing, as well as from our host's sounding slaps on
his bare limbs, the kilt not being just the thing for a
defence against Monsieur Musquitto.  Indeed, after
Rory's localities had been fairly explored by these
stinging pests, we suffered little, as they left us all (like
reasonable animals choosing their food, where it was
easiest to be had) in comparative peace, to settle in
clouds on the unfortunate Highlander's naked premises.
</p>

<p>
At length he could stand it no longer.&mdash;"Tuncan!"&mdash;then
a loud slap on his thigh;&mdash;"Lachlan!"&mdash;another
slap;&mdash;"Macintosh, pring a prush, pring a
prush!"&mdash;and a negro appeared forthwith with a bunch
of green twigs with the leaves on.&mdash;"Noo, Macintosh,
kang pelow tae table with your prush, and prush my
leeks free from tae awful plakues.  Prush, ye prute,
prush!"
</p>

<p>
This scheme had the desired effect; the enemy was
driven off, and Rory, in the fulness and satisfaction of
his heart, now insisted on setting Tuncan to give us a
regular pibroch, as he called it, on the bagpipe, whether
we would or not.
</p>

<p>
I had observed Quacco, who had accompanied us,
and that mischief-maker, Squire Flamingo, in close
confabulation while dinner was getting ready; I
therefore made sure of witnessing some comical issue of
their complot before long, in which I was not
disappointed&mdash;for the black serjeant now ushered in the
bagpiper, whom, I could perceive, he had fuddled pretty
considerably, besides adding to his rig in a most
fantastical manner.  He had, it seems, persuaded the
poor creature that he was by no means complete
without a queue, and powder in his hair; so he now
appeared with his woolly poll covered with flour, and
the spout of an old tin watering-pan, with a tuft of red
hair from the tail of a cow stuck into the end of it,
attached to the back of his head by a string.  In the
midst of this tuft I saw a small red spark, and when he
approached there was a very perceptible burning smell,
as of the smouldering of a slow match.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Mr Flamingo," said I to our friend, "I see
you are about wickedness&mdash;No more percussion
powder, I hope?"
</p>

<p>
He trod on my toe, and winked.&mdash;"Hush, you shall see."
</p>

<p>
When Tuncan first entered, he had, to save himself
from falling, sat down on a chair close by the door,
with his back to us.  This was altogether out of
character, for Tuncan plumed himself on his breeding.
</p>

<p>
"Is tat your mainers, you plack rascal?" cried
Rory.  "Ket up, sir, or"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Quacco was at hand, and assisting the sable retainer
to rise, got him on his pins; and when he had fairly
planted him on his parade ground, which was the end
of the piazza farthest from us, he seemed to recover
himself, blew up his pipes, and began to walk
mechanically backwards and forwards steadily enough.
Flamingo kept his eye en him very earnestly, while a small
twitch of his cheek, just below his eye, every now and
then, and a slight lifting of the corner of his mouth,
showed that the madcap was waiting in expectation of
some fun.  All conversation had been fairly swamped
by the infernal pipes&mdash;Roderick's peacock hen, had she
been alive, could not have made herself heard, so we
had nothing else for it but to look at each other, and
listen to the black bagpiper.  I am sure I wished him
any where but where he was, when, just as he had
turned his back to us in one of his pendulum movements,
a jet of sparks like those from a squib issued
from his queue, which, drunk as he was, made him turn
round fast enough; the instant he found that the fire
proceeded from his own tail, he dashed down his
bagpipes, rushed out of the house, and never stopped
until he was up to the neck in the muddy duck-pond
before the door, still fizzing most furiously.  In a vain
attempt to rid himself of the annoyance, he dipped
his head below the water, and just as he disappeared,
a crack&mdash;crack&mdash;crack showed that the squib had
<i>eventuated</i>, as the Yankees say, in the usual manner,
viz. in a zigzag, or cracker.
</p>

<p>
It turned out afterwards, as I suspected, that
Quacco, who was a tolerable fireworker, amongst his other
accomplishments, at Flamingo's instigation had beat
up some charcoal and gunpowder, moistening the
mass well, and filled the tin tube which composed
poor Tuncan's queue with it; thus literally converting
it into a squib.
</p>

<p>
Great was the amazement of Master Roderick at
all this, and loud were his exclamations as his retainer
was dragged out of the pond, more dead than alive
with fear, and all but choked with mud; seeing,
however, that he had been drinking, and, what was more in
blackey's favour, his master having been indulging
himself, he was, after much entreaty, pleased to send
the poor fellow home, instead of clapping him in the
stocks.
</p>

<p>
I had noticed that a little mulatto boy, also in a
kilt, had been the chief agent in the extrication of
poor Tuncan.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Lachlan," said Mr Frenche to this lad,
"when did you return?  Why, I thought you were
in Scotland!"
</p>

<p>
"So he was," said Rory.  "I sent him last fall to
my sister in tae Western Highlands, that is married
<i>upon</i> tae minister; put she returned tae puir callant
py next post, saying she was surprised that I should
make no more of sending home my&mdash;I'll no say what&mdash;and
<i>them</i> yellow too, than if <i>they</i> were sae mony
tame monkeys&mdash;'<i>and to a minister's hoose</i>!'&mdash;Maype,
if they hat na heard of my coffee crop having peen
purned in the store, and if I hat no forgotten to say
ony thing apoot tae callant's poord, tey wad na hae
peen sae straitlaced."
</p>

<p>
It was now getting dark,&mdash;the horses had been
some time at the door, and we were about saying
good-night to Rory and Flamingo, who was to take up his
quarters for the evening, in order, as previously
arranged, to his having a day's shooting at wild-ducks
and pigeons on the morrow, when it suddenly came on
to rain, as if a waterspout had burst over head; so the
animals were ordered back into the stable, as it was
out of the question starting in such a <i>pour</i>.
</p>

<p>
We had coffee, and were waiting impatiently for
it to clear, but it came down faster and faster, and soon
began to thunder and lighten most awfully.
</p>

<p>
I am not ashamed to acknowledge that a storm of
this description always moves me; and although the
rest of the party carried on in the inner hall at a game
at whist, while Roderick and I were having a hit at
backgammon in a corner, none of them appearing to
care much about it; yet one explosion was so loud, go
simultaneous with the blue blinding flash, and the
reverberations immediately afterwards <i>thundered</i>&mdash;I can
find no stronger word&mdash;so tremendously overhead,
making the whole house shake, and the glasses ring
on the sideboard, that both parties suddenly, and with
one accord, stopped and started to their feet, in the
middle of their amusement.  Where I stood, I had a
full view into the long vista of the natural wood
already mentioned, festooned from tree to tree with a
fantastic network of withes, which, between us and the
lightning, looked like an enormous spider's web.
Another bright flash again lit up the recesses of the
forest, showing distinctly, although but for a moment, a
long string of mules, loaded with coffee bags, with a
dark figure mounted on every third animal, and blasting
every object, the masses of green foliage on the trees
especially, into a smoky and sulphurous blue.
</p>

<p>
Before the rumbling of this thunder-clap had passed
over our heads, the noise of the rain on the hollow
wooden roof increased to a deafening roar, like the
sound of a water-fall, or as if every drop had been a
musket-bullet.
</p>

<p>
"Tat's hail!" said Rory, in great amazement at such
an unusual occurrence.
</p>

<p>
"Small doubt of that," quoth Flamingo.
</p>

<p>
Here one of the negro servants came running in.
"Massa&mdash;massa&mdash;sugar-plum fall from de moon&mdash;sugar-plum
fall from de moon&mdash;see, see," and opening
his palms, where he had caught the hail, and thought
he had it safe, and finding only drops of water, he
drew back as if he had seen a spirit&mdash;"Gone! gone! and
<i>burn</i> my hand too; Obeah&mdash;most be Obeah!"
and before another word could be said, it lightned
again so vividly, even through the sparkling mist of
hail, that I involuntarily put my hands to my eyes,
and lay back in my chair, overcome with breathless awe.
</p>

<p>
Unlike any lightning I had ever seen before, it was
as if a dart of fire had struck the large tree next us
right in the cleft, and then glanced like a ray of the
most intense light shot down into the centre of the
back yard, where it zigzagged along, and tore up the
solid ground, that appeared covered with white smoke
from the bounding and hopping of the rattling
hailstones.  I can compare the sharpness of the report
that accompanied it to nothing more fittingly than
that of a long eighteen-pounder fired close to the ear.
Involuntarily I repeated to myself that magnificent
passage of sacred writ&mdash;"And the Lord sent thunder
and hail, and the fire ran along upon the ground; so
there was hail, and fire mingled with the hail, very
grievous."
</p>

<p>
A long tearing <i>rive</i>, as of the violent disruption of
a large bough, had instantly succeeded the flash, and
then a crashing and rushing heavy fall, and loud shrieks.
It was nearly a minute before any of us found breath
to speak, and then it was only in short half-suppressed
exclamations.
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" as a smouldering yellow flame
burst from the roof of the negro house that adjoined
the Macgregor's habitation, and gradually illuminated
the whole scene&mdash;the glistering hail-covered ground,
the tall trees overhead, the cattle that had run beneath
them for shelter&mdash;and showed a large limb split off
from the immense cedar next us (with the white
splinter-mark glancing), that still adhered to the
parent tree by some strong fibres; while the outermost
branches had fallen heavily on, and crushed in the
roof of the cottage that was on fire.
</p>

<p>
The lurid flashes continued, contrasting most fearfully
with the bright red glare of the burning cottage,
the inhabitants of which, a woman and three children,
were now extricating themselves, and struggling from
under the fallen roof.  Presently we saw them cluster
round a dark object lying in the middle of the yard
like a log, between us and the tree that had been
struck.  They stooped down, and appeared to pull it
about, whatever it was, for a minute or so, and then
began to toss their arms, uttering loud cries.  I was
puzzling myself as to what they could be after, when
the word was passed amongst the black domestics of
"a man kill&mdash;old Cudjoe kill."  This ran like
wildfire, and in a second we were all out in the midst of
the storm, with the rapidly melting hail-stones
crunching beneath our feet.
</p>

<p>
The body was brought into the house, and the
doctor being fortunately on the spot, every thing was
done that could be devised, but all in vain.  When a
vein was opened in the arm, the blood flowed
sluggishly, but was quite fluid; and all the joints were
even more than naturally pliant, the vertebrae of the
neck especially.  Indeed I had never seen such a
general muscular relaxation; but the poor old fellow
was quite dead.  One spot on the cape of his Pennistone
greatcoat, about the size of a dollar, was burnt
black, and so completely consumed, that in carrying
him into the house, which was no easy matter, from
the extreme pliancy and eel-like limberness, if I may
so speak, of the whole body, the tinder or burnt woollen
dropped out, leaving a round hole as clean as if it had
been <i>gouged</i> out.
</p>

<p>
After this unfortunate transaction we had little
spirit to pursue our amusement, and accordingly, after
a parting cup, we all retired to bed.
</p>

<p>
I soon fell asleep, and remembered nothing until I
was awakened by the crowing of the cocks in the
morning.  It was still dark, and in the unceiled and
low-roofed house I could hear my allies snoring most
harmoniously in their several snuggeries.  At length,
after several long yawns, and a few preparatory snorts,
and clearances of his voice, out spoke my restless
acquaintance, Master Flamingo.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Rory&mdash;Rory Macgregor&mdash;how sound the
body sleeps&mdash;why, Rory, I say"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Oich, oich, fat's tat&mdash;wha's tat&mdash;and what will
she pe wantin'?"
</p>

<p>
"Wanting?&mdash;Don't you remember your promise?
Didn't I tell you that I had come to spend the night
here, in order to have a crack at the ducks this morning?"
</p>

<p>
"Ducks this morning," thought I&mdash;"Ducks&mdash;does
the madcap mean to shoot ducks, after such a
night and such a scene?"
</p>

<p>
"Tucks," grunted Rory&mdash;"tucks?" then a long snore.
</p>

<p>
"Ducks, to be sure; so get up, Mac&mdash;get up."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well," yawned the Macgregor; "I will,
I will; put ton't waken tae hail hoose&mdash;ton't tisturp
Mr Frenche nor Mr Prail."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, never mind, Flamingo," quoth my uncle,
turning himself in his bed, and clearing his voice;
"I am awake, and Dennis has brought my gun I find."
</p>

<p>
And here followed a concerto of coughing, and
yawning, and groaning, and puffing, as of the pulling
on of tight or damp boots, and rumblings and stumblings
against the furniture of the various apartments,
and all the other miscellaneous noises incidental to a
party dressing in the dark.
</p>

<p>
"Romulus, a light," shouted Twig.
</p>

<p>
"Twister, a ditto," roared Flamingo; and these
exclamations called forth a renewed volley of
snortings and long yawns from the negro servants, who
were sleeping in the inner hall.
</p>

<p>
"Twister, get me a light, you lazy villain, don't
you hear?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, massa, directly"&mdash;snore.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Directly</i>, you sleepy dog!&mdash;<i>now</i>, sir&mdash;get it me
<i>now</i>.  Don't you hear that I have broken my shin,
and capsized the basin-stand, and I can't tell what
besides?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, yes, massa"&mdash;snore again.
</p>

<p>
I heard a door open, and presently a loud tumble,
and a crackling and rattling of chairs, and startled
cries from the negroes.
</p>

<p>
"Murder!  Twig&mdash;where's your patent lucifer
match box?  Here have I fallen over that rascal of
yours, and I am terrified to move, lest I break my
own neck, or extinguish some black fellow out and
out.  Gemini! if my great toe has not got into some
one's mouth.  Hillo, Quashie, mind that's my toe,
and not a yam.  Oh dear, will no one get me a candle?
Jacob, you cannibal, do come and rescue me, or I shall
be smothered amidst this odoriferous and flat-nosed
variety of the human species."
</p>

<p>
I had never spent such a morning, and as it was
quite evident that there was no more sleep to be had,
I got up and dressed the best way I could.  We were
soon all congregated in the inner hall by candle light,
with half a dozen black fellows, and as many fowling-pieces,
blunderbusses, and muskets as there were buccras,
ready to sally forth to attack the teal.
</p>

<p>
Quacco was here, as elsewhere, the most active of the
throng, and sideling up to me, "Massa, you and de
old gentleman take de blonderboosh&mdash;I hab load dem
bote wid one bushel of dock hail.  You shall never see
so much bird as you shall knock down&mdash;take dem,
massa&mdash;take dem."
</p>

<p>
After coffee, we put ourselves <i>en route</i> and sallied
out of the house.
</p>

<p>
"Why, uncle," said I, "I have no great stomach
for the fight after what happened last night."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo," said he, "never mind&mdash;people don't
mind a thunder-storm here."
</p>

<p>
"But then the poor old watchman&mdash;struck down
almost before one's eyes."
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that was melancholy enough&mdash;but it can't be
helped, so come along, you must do as others do."
</p>

<p>
The morning was thick, dark, damp, and dreary;
there should have been a moon, but she had veiled her
beauties behind the steamy clouds, that seemed to be
resting themselves on the tree-tops.  The earth sent
up its vapours, as of water poured on hot bricks; and
all the herbs and grass and leaves of bushes, through
which the footpath lay, seemed absolute <i>blobs</i> of
water, for the instant you touched them they dissolved
into a shower-bath; while I soon perceived that I was
walking ankle deep in soft mud&mdash;indeed we were
travelling as much by water as on terra firma.  After
<i>ploutering</i> through this chaos for about a mile, we
entered a natural savannah, inlaid with several ponds,
which looked like dark mirrors, dimmed by the films
of thin grey mist that floated on their calm surfaces.
Rory walked round several of these natural pieces of
water, while the negro scouts were also very active;
but it was all&mdash;"The tiel a tuck is tere," from Rory.
"The devil a teal is here," from Flamingo.  And "no
teal, no dere; no duck no here; none at all," from the
negroes.
</p>

<p>
"So we shall have been roused out of our warm
beds, and soaked to the skin, to say nothing of a very
sufficient plastering with mud, for no use after all,"
said I.
</p>

<p>
"No fear&mdash;no fear&mdash;only have patience a little,"
quoth Mr Twig.
</p>

<p>
There was a low marshy ditch that ran across the
savannah, nearer the house than where we now were,
that had overflowed from the rains, and which covered
about six acres of the natural pasture.  We had waded
through it on our advance, expecting to find the teal
in the ponds beyond.  But being unsuccessful, we now
tried back, and returned to it; and just as we faced
about, the clouds lifted from the hill tops in the east,
and disclosed a long clear stripe of primrose-coloured
sky, the forerunner of early day-dawn.  As we
reapproached the flooded ground, one or two cranes
sounded their trumpet notes, and taking wing with a
rustling splashy flaff, glided silently past us.
</p>

<p>
"Halt," quoth Serjeant Quacco, in a whisper,
"halt, gentlemen, I hear de teal on de feed."
</p>

<p>
"The deuce you do!" said I, "you must have the
ears of an Indian;" and we all held our breath, and
stooped and leant our ears towards the ground, in
imitation of the serjeant; and to be sure we now heard
distinctly enough the short quacks of the drakes, and
the rustling and cackling of the feathered squadrons
among the reeds.  My uncle, the Macgregor, and
myself, were planted at the westernmost end of the
swamp; two of us armed with blunderbusses, and the
Celt with his double-barrelled gun&mdash;while Messrs
Twig, Flamingo, and Quacco, made a sweep towards
the head of it, or eastern end.
</p>

<p>
The rustling continued, as of great numbers of large
birds on the opposite side; while near at hand we
heard an occasional plump, and tiny splashes, such as
a large frog makes when he drops into the water, and
curious crawling and crackling noises, made, according
to my conception, by reptiles of some kind or another,
amongst the reeds.
</p>

<p>
"Any alligators here?" whispered I to Mr Frenche,
who was next me.
</p>

<p>
"Great many," was the laconic reply.
</p>

<p>
"How comfortable," thought I; "and snakes?"
</p>

<p>
"Abundance."
</p>

<p>
"Pleasant country," said I Benjie, again to myself.
But all this time I could see nothing like the teal we
were in pursuit of, although it was as clear as mud
that the reeds all round us were alive with something
or another.  At length, as the morning lightened, and
the clouds broke away, and the steamy sheet of water
began to reflect them and our dark figures, and the
trees and other objects on the margin, a line of ten or
a dozen large birds emerged from the darkness and
mist at the end where Flamingo was situated, and
began slowly to sail towards us in regular line of battle.
</p>

<p>
"Tere tae come at last&mdash;noo&mdash;mak reaty, Maister
Prail; frient Frenche, pe prepared," and Rory himself,
lying down on his chest on the wet grass, and taking
deliberate aim, fired both barrels&mdash;and such a squatter!&mdash;as
a flock of a thousand teal, I am certain there could
not have been fewer, rose into the air with a loud
rushing noise like the sound of a mighty stream&mdash;a perfect
<i>roar</i> of ducks.  I fired my bellmouthed trabucco with
the bushel of shot at random into the thickest of the
flock, and so did mine uncle; whereupon <i>down</i> came
a feathery shower upon our <i>heads</i>, and <i>down</i> came we
both on our <i>tails</i>&mdash;the bushels of shot having told in
more ways than one.  This hot discharge had the effect,
however, of turning the flock, and Flamingo and Twig
had their own share of the spoil at the head of the
swamp.  The four shots had brought down four-and-thirty
feathered bipeds, and two without feathers&mdash;we
were as regularly smothered in ducks, as you ever saw
a rabbit in onions.
</p>

<p>
"I say, uncle, how do you feel?"
</p>

<p>
"Rather chilly at tother end of me, Benjie; and I
believe my shoulder is dislocated," quoth he,
scratching his bald pate, as he sat on the ground, where
Quacco's bushels of shot had deposited both of us.
</p>

<p>
"And my cheek is stove in," quoth I.
</p>

<p>
"My nose is bleeding like a pump," quoth he.
</p>

<p>
"And mine is blown off entirely," said I.  Here
we both got on our feet, the ground around us being
literally covered with killed, and alive with the
wounded birds.
</p>

<p>
"See if our facsimiles in the soft mud are not like
two punch bowls, Benjie?"  And true enough we had
made a couple of holes in the spungy soil, that instantly
filled with water as we rose, leaving two round pools.
</p>

<p>
"I say, uncle, your punchbowl is somewhat the
biggest of the two, though, eh? mine is only the jigger."
</p>

<p>
"Bah!" quoth he, showing his white teeth.
</p>

<p>
But how came Rory on all this while, the hero who
had led into action?  Right in front of us, half a dozen
black spots rested dead still, where his shot had just
torn up the sleeping surface of the grey swamp, while
as many more waterfowl of some description or
another, that had been wounded, were quacking and
splashing, and wheeling, half flying, and half running
on the water, in a vain attempt to escape from the
Macgregor, who, in the enthusiasm of the moment,
had dashed in up to his waist to secure the prey.
</p>

<p>
And there he was chasing the wounded birds, all
about, every now and then tripping in the weeds, and
delving down, nose and ears, under water; whereby he
lost his hat and dropped his gun, puffing and snorting
all the time with many an outlandish exclamation, and
dripping like a water-god.
</p>

<p>
"Never was such a morning's sport," roared the
Highlander, "never did I see such pluidy wark in aw
my porn days; stalking tae ret tear is nothing to it,"
as he regained terra firma, with both hands filled
with ducks' legs and necks as full as he could gripe;
the wounded birds flaffing and flapping, and struggling
round him, as if they would have flown away with the
wee Hieland body up into the air.
</p>

<p>
By this time I had secured my wounded, and the
daylight was fast brightening.
</p>

<p>
"Quacco, my man," said uncle Lathom to the
serjeant, as he passed him, "the next time you clap a
<i>bushel</i> of shot into my gun, pray don't let it be
imperial measure, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Twig, who had now joined us, "this
is capital sport certainly.  Never saw such a flock of
teal in my life before&mdash;but, Roderick, what have you
got there&mdash;what sort of game is that you have shot&mdash;let
me see?"  Here he deliberately counted out of the
Macgregor's hands eight large <i>tame</i> Muscovy ducks,
and a goose.
</p>

<p>
"As I am a sinner," said the poor Highlander, in
great dismay when he saw what he had been about,
"if I have not killed my own puire tucks; and the
vera coose hersell that I expected to eat at Michaelmas.
Hoo cam tae here&mdash;hoo tae teevil cam tae oot
o' the pen?" and he turned a fierce look at his
servant.  Alas, on reflection, he remembered that the
poor old man who was killed by the lightning had been
the hen<i>man</i>, and no one having taken his place, and
the pen having been beaten down by the hail overnight,
the sacrifice of the ducks and the poor Michaelmas
goose had been the consequence and crowning misfortune.
</p>

<p>
But the absurdity of our entertainer having shown
his expertness as a shot by murdering his own poultry
was too much, and it was with the greatest difficulty
any of us could keep his gravity.
</p>

<p>
We returned to the house&mdash;shifted, breakfasted,
and that forenoon returned to Ballywindle, where we
spent an exceedingly pleasant week with our friends
Twig and Flamingo, who, in the mean time, prevailed
on Mr Frenche to make a return visit to them in
Kingston, and we accordingly prepared for our trip.
</p>

<p>
It was the Saturday before the Monday on which
we meant to start.  I was playing at piquet with Mr
Twig; my uncle and Flamingo were lounging about
the piazza, and the horses were ready saddled for an
airing, at the door, when my antagonist and I were
startled by a loud rushing, or rather roaring noise, that
seemed to pass immediately overhead.  "A flock of
teal," thought I, remembering the exploit at Rory
Macgregor's.  Simultaneously all the shutters, which,
according to the usual West India fashion, opened
outwards, were banged to with great force&mdash;doors were
slammed, and the whole house shook with the
suddenness of the gust.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," said Twig, "what's all this?" as his point,
quint, and quatorze were whisked out of his hand, and
a shower of gritting sand, with a dash of small pebbles
in it, was driven against our faces through the open
windows, like a discharge of peas.
</p>

<p>
My uncle and his companion had halted in their
walk, and seemed as much surprised as we were.
Presently the noise ceased, and all was calm again where
we were.  We naturally looked down into the
mill-yard below us to see what would take place there.
</p>

<p>
It was as busy as usual&mdash;the negro boys and girls
were shouting to the mules and steers, as they drove
them round the circles of the cattle mills&mdash;the mule
drivers, each with a tail of three mules loaded with
canes from the hilly cane-pieces, where waggons could
not work, were stringing into the yard, and spanking
their whips.  The wains, each with a team of six oxen,
yoked two and two, built up with canes as high as a
hay waggon, were rumbling and rattling on their jolty
axletrees, as they were dragged through deep clayey
ruts, that would have broken Macadam's heart to have
looked on; the boilermen were shouting in the
boiling-house, their voices, from the reverberation of the
lofty roof, rising loud above the confusion, as if they
had been speaking in masks, like the Greek and Roman
actors of old; and the negro girls were singing cheerily
in parts, their songs blending with their loud laughter,
as they carried bundles of canes to be ground, or
balanced their large baskets full of <i>trash</i> on their heads,
while the creaking of the mill machinery, and the
crashing of the canes between the rollers, added to the
buzz.
</p>

<p>
The dry sun was shining down, like a burning-glass,
into the centre of this ant's nest, where every thing
was rolling on, as it had been doing for hours before,
no one apparently anticipating any unusual occurrence;
but in an instant the tornado that had passed
us reached <i>them</i>, whirled the trash baskets off the
negroes' heads nearest us, and up went whole bundles of
canes bodily into the air, and negro hats and jackets;
indeed, every thing that would rise, and ruffling the
garments of the black ladies most unceremoniously,
notwithstanding all their endeavours to preserve their
propriety, so that they looked like large umbrellas
reversed, the shanks, in most cases, being something of
the stoutest.
</p>

<p>
Before it took effect in the hollow, every thing was
in motion; by the time it passed over, every thing
it did not take with it <i>was fixed to the spot</i>, as if by the
wand of an enchanter.  Negroes were clinging to the
bamboos of the cattle pens; cattle and mules were
standing as rigid as statues, gathered on their haunches,
with their forelegs planted well and firmly out, the
better to resist the effects of the wind.  The mill had
instantly stopped, and all was silent.
</p>

<p>
But the instant Quashie recovered his surprise, and
every thing had become calm again in the mill-yard,
there arose <i>such</i> a cackling, shouting, and laughter,
and lowing of kine, and <i>skreiching</i> of mules, as Rory
Macgregor would have said, as baffles all description.
</p>

<p>
The course of the tornado, after passing over the
mill-yard, continued to be distinctly marked, by the
different substances it carried up and whirled round in
its vortex, keeping them suspended in the air by its
violent centrifugal motion; I especially remember the
effect it had on a grove of cocoa-nut trees.  It took
them by the tops, which it tossed fiercely with a wide
circular motion, tearing their long leaves up into the
sky like hair, as if some invisible spirit was trying to
shake the fruit down from the tormented trees.  As it
neared a field where a number of people were at work,
one of the house servants, rubbing his black paws,
whispered to his neighbour in my hearing, "Softly,
now&mdash;maybe it will whip away busha"&mdash;a thing he,
to all appearance, would not have broken his heart about.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, at breakfast, I stumbled on the
following announcement in the newspaper I had just
taken up:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Lucie&mdash;such a date.</i>
</p>

<p>
"Last evening the Kingston trader, the Ballahoo,
anchored in Negril bay.  She had been cut out by
two piratical vessels, a felucca and a schooner, from
Montego bay, on such a day; and after having been
in possession of the pirates for a week, during which
the Spanish passengers were compelled to disclose
where their money (the only thing taken) was
concealed, she was <i>politely</i> given up to them and the
crew.
</p>

<p>
"The felucca is Spanish built, painted black outside,
and red within, and sails remarkably fast; the schooner
is a long, low, but very heavily armed vessel, painted
black, with a red streak&mdash;no guns were seen in the
felucca."&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"So, so, poor Hause has got his vessel, then; but
that wicked little Midge, I fear her cruising is not over
yet," said I, handing the paragraph to my uncle, who,
as he already knew the story, easily comprehended the
import of the newspaper announcement&mdash;"well, I am
glad of it"&mdash;And I resumed my attack on the yams,
ham, and coffee.
</p>

<p>
Mr Frenche put on his spectacles, and, as he began
the perusal of the paper, said dryly, "I suppose you
consider that the letter lying on the table there,
addressed to you, will keep cool&mdash;at least you appear to
be in no hurry to open it."&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
I seized it&mdash;not having previously noticed it, and
blushed like I don't know what, when I perceived it was
in very truth her dear, delightful, and all the rest of it,
<i>fist</i>&mdash;there's a sentence ending plump for you&mdash;my
hand trembled as I broke the seal, or rather <i>drew</i> it
open; for in such a climate wax is so soft, you cannot
call it <i>breaking</i>, which always implies a short, sharp
crackle, to my mind&mdash;assuming a careless swaggering
look, I began to peruse it.  I could with the tail of my
eye, however, perceive Friend Twig and Monsieur
Flamingo exchange very knowing glances.  But here
goes&mdash;here is <i>the</i> letter:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Havanna&mdash;such a date</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAR BENJAMIN,
</p>

<p>
"I expected to have had an opportunity of writing
by a vessel for Jamaica before this, but have been
disappointed.
</p>

<p>
"You will be surprised at our change of plans.  A
grand uncle of my father's, a very old man, has lately
died, and left some money and land to us in the
United Kingdom"&mdash;(a Yankyeism, thought I&mdash;<i>United</i>
States, <i>United</i> Kingdom)&mdash;"and in consequence he
is obliged to go out to England immediately"&mdash;(<i>out</i>
to England).  "His first determination was to send
mamma and me home to New York, but as we did not
like to leave him, we have persuaded him that we shall
make ourselves very portable, so we all go together,
in a fine London ship, to sail the day after to-morrow.
Dicky Phantom, dear pet, says, 'Oh, I shall make
myself more leetle small, as one busy bee dat make de
honey.'  I am angry at myself sometimes, but I almost
dread going to the 'old country,' lest we should be
obliged to restore the darling little castaway to his
kinsfolk&mdash;I am sure none of them can ever love him
more than his <i>mamma</i> Helen does.  Any letter you may
write to me, you must now send to the care of the House
of Baring Brothers of London.  As I have no
concealments from mamma, and as you always give me
credit" (<i>credit</i>, in the mouth of a young lady!) "for
being a circumspect person, she has arranged for me,
that at all events we shall not leave England until we
hear from you in answer to this; so I have made a
duplicate of it" (<i>duplicate</i> of a love letter, ye gods!),
"a thing that has proved more irksome than writing
ten originals, which I will send by the next
opportunity, as I know you would be sadly annoyed if any
confusion should take place, such as your going to
New York, and finding us abroad" (<i>abroad</i>&mdash;in
England); "at least, I know, my dearest Benjamin, I should
be miserable at the thoughts of it."  (Well you might,
my lady, thought I)&mdash;"I am all impatience for another
letter from you," (why, she has not acknowledged one
yet); "surely your excellent uncle will enter into
your feelings; indeed I have satisfied my heart that he
will, and made up my mind not to distress myself, in
the mean time, in the hope that all will run smooth
with us.  You see I have no darts, and flames, and
nonsense for you&mdash;nothing <i>ultra</i>, Benjamin&mdash;no
superlatives&mdash;I have studied myself as well as I can, and
there is no character, I am persuaded, that suits me
so well as what you gave me.  I am a quiet, prudent,
unobtrusive, but warm-hearted little woman&mdash;there is
a vain girl for you&mdash;and oh, Benjamin, my heart tells
me, if I am spared in <i>His</i> mercy, that you will find what
my father says to be true, 'Whoever marries my
Helen will get a wife that will wear well, <i>I calculate</i>.'
</p>

<p>
"You will be surprised to learn that the old
Gazelle is here again.  After being a week out, she was
forced back from bad weather, and is now repairing.
Poor Mr Donovan has had to invalid; they say he
never recovered his severe illness on the coast of
Africa, and was always raving about some fair one with
one eye, who lived in a street to which Broadway in
York was a narrow lane&mdash;but it is a melancholy affair
for him, poor young man, and I check my thoughts,
and stop my pen, as I had a jest regarding him, that
was ready to drop from it.
</p>

<p>
"And what do you think?&mdash;Henry de Walden has
got an acting order as lieutenant in his stead.  The
ship had been a week here, before Mr Donovan could
make up his mind, and all that time Master Henry
never once looked near us, and poor Sophie did nothing
but spoil wax flowers, and weep&mdash;but, two days ago,
as she and I were returning in the volante from our
evening drive, who should we meet, in charge of a
party of seamen who were returning from the funeral
of a comrade who had died that morning&mdash;oh, Benjamin,
what a fearful climate this is&mdash;but him!&mdash;He
did not see us until we were close upon him, when I
desired the driver to pull up, so he could not escape us
if he had tried it; poor Sophie lay back in the volante,
out of sight, as she thought&mdash;I am sure I heard her
heart beat.  I asked him why he had not come to see
us&mdash;he seemed unprepared to answer; indeed, as you
used to say, he was evidently taken completely aback&mdash;and
blushed, and then grew pale, and blushed again&mdash;for
he saw very well who was cowering at the back of
the carriage.&mdash;'I was going to call on you this very
evening,' he said, at length; 'I thought you would all
be glad to hear of my promotion'&mdash;Poor Sophie's rigid
clasp round my waist relaxed, and she gave a sigh as
if her heart had burst&mdash;but it was her pent feelings
that had been relieved,&mdash;'Your promotion!' I cried,
in great joy.&mdash;'Yes, I have got poor Mr Donovan's
vacancy,'&mdash;'Dead?  Is poor Mr Donovan dead?'&mdash;'No,'
continued he, 'he is not dead, but has invalided
this forenoon, and Sir Oliver has given me an acting
order as lieutenant in his stead.  I make no doubt it
will be confirmed; indeed he said he knows it will.'
</p>

<p>
"He came in the evening according to his promise,
and most happy we were to see him&mdash;but what a world
of changes&mdash;the very next day the Spider arrived,
when we heard of your narrow escape; to show you
my composure, I have purposely kept this out of
sight until this moment, nor will I say much now.  I
went when I heard it, and offered up my prayers to
that Almighty Being who rules over all, and orders
every thing for the best, although we poor
shortsighted creatures may not see it, and blessed <i>His</i>
holy name, that you had safely reached your destination.
</p>

<p>
"But I am getting confused, I find.  The bearer
of your letter, poor young man, is no more&mdash;he died
this morning of yellow fever.  And who do you think
is appointed to the Spider?&mdash;why, Henry De Walden,
once more&mdash;nothing, you see, but Henry de Walden!
</p>

<p>
"To make a long story short, Mr Duquesné has
now given his consent to their union, but old Sir
Oliver, who exercises a <i>great</i>, and to me unaccountable
control over Henry, will not hear of it, until he is
made commander, so they must both live in hope;
but for the moment, they are but too happy to be
extricated from the gloomy slough of despond in which
they had made up their minds they were both set fast.
My father, mamma, Mr Duquesné, Sophie, and Henry
De Walden, all unite in kindest regards to you.  And
now, my dearest Benjamin, do not be alarmed at this
blistered manuscript; my heart is melting, and
weeping relieves me, but I am not unhappy&mdash;oh, no&mdash;but
anxious&mdash;oh, <i>how</i> anxious!&mdash;I will now retire to my
closet, and cast myself before the rock of my trust,
and pray to my God, and your God, in whose great
hand we stand, to bless us both; and speedily, <i>if</i> it be
his good pleasure, to bring us once more together,
never to be parted.  I am fond and foolish,
Benjamin&mdash;fond and foolish&mdash;but I know to whom I write.
The seaman who waits for the letters is ordered on
board, and I must conclude.  Give my love to your
uncle&mdash;I am sure I shall <i>love him</i>&mdash;tell him he <i>must
love</i> me, for your sake, if not for my own.  Once
more adieu, and God bless you.

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
</h3>

<h4>
OCCIDENTAL VAGARIES.
</h4>

<p>
Early on the Monday, we accordingly started on
our journey, and that evening arrived at very
comfortable quarters in St Ann's bay.
</p>

<p>
We did not get under weigh next morning until
the sun was high&mdash;it was nearly ten in the forenoon,
as we had only to go the length of Prickly Pear
cottage that day, a property belonging to a crony of mine
uncle's, at which we had promised to dine and spend
the night on our way to St Thomas in the Vale,
where we were to call a halt, to attend some military
dinner or another at Bogwalk tavern.
</p>

<p>
The beauty of St Ann's, the principal grazing
parish of Jamaica, surpassed any notion I had previously
formed of it;&mdash;the whole district being a sea of gently
undulating hill and valley, covered with the most
luxuriant waving Guinea grass&mdash;across which the
racking cloudlets, borne on the wings of the fresh and
invigorating breeze, chased each other cheerily as if
it had been one vast hay field, ready for the
scythe&mdash;thickly interspersed with groves of pimento and
fruit-trees, whose picturesque situations no <i>capability</i> man
could possibly improve.  The herds of cattle that
browsed all round us, whether as to breed or condition,
would have done credit to the first grazing county in
England.  Lord Althorp should go and take a squint
at St Ann's&mdash;I daresay the worthies there might make
him custos.
</p>

<p>
At length, as it drew on to three in the afternoon,
we saw the cottage glittering in all the West India
glory of green blinds and white paint, through the
grove of fruit-trees in the centre of which it was
placed.  It was a long low one-story house, raised
about ten feet off the ground on brick pillars, under
which gamboled half-a-dozen goats, and surrounded by
a cool and airy piazza, while the neighbouring thickets
were peppered with a whole cluster of small white-washed
buildings, comprising kitchen, gard-du-mange,
houses for the domestics, pigsties, and poultry-yard.
</p>

<p>
We dismounted at one end of the piazza, where a
door, kept gaping ajar by a large stone on the floor, to
which access was had by a flight of steps, seemed to
invite us to walk in.  We ascended the stair and
entered.  The dark mirrorlike floors, the fragrant odour
of the fresh gathered bitter oranges which had been
just used in polishing them, the green shade of the
trees that overshadowed the building, tossing their
branches, and rushing and twittering in the sea
breeze&mdash;the beautiful flowers that crept in at every open
blind and crevice&mdash;(a knot in the weather boarding
could not drop out but in would pop a rose, or a bud
of double jessamine, as if trying to escape the ardent
gaze of the sun)&mdash;the twilight of the rooms, and the
glorious view of the everlasting ocean in the distance
(with a tiny white winglet of a sail sliding along here
and there), crisped with blue waves, as if the water
had reflected the mackerel sky that glowed over all,
until both were blended out at sea beneath a silvery
haze&mdash;were indescribably luxurious and refreshing&mdash;their
sweet and cooling influences more strongly felt,
from the contrast they afforded to the heat and dust
of the lowland road we had just left.  Oh!  I
could&mdash;curse it&mdash;<i>there's</i> a mackaw&mdash;there <i>is a</i> mackaw&mdash;a
bird I detest and abominate&mdash;so my poetry is all blown
to the moon in a jiffy.  I would rather sit and listen
to the music of the setting of a saw, while enjoying
the luxury of a sick headach.&mdash;But let me whistle
back my fancy again, and get on with my story.
</p>

<p>
Several ladies' work-tables, with the work lying on
them, tumbled as it were in haste, and chairs
disarranged, showed that our approach had not been
observed until we were close aboard, and that the fair
members of the family had that moment fled, in order
to make themselves presentable; indeed this was
vouched for by the laughing, and <i>fistling</i>, and
<i>keckling</i> we heard in a room, whose window opened into
the piazza.
</p>

<p>
Presently a tidily-dressed brown waiting-maiden,
with flowers on her gown the size of the crown of my
hat, and of the gaudiest colours, popped her head in
at the door, and after showing her white teeth,
disappeared.  She had very evidently been sent to
reconnoitre, and I could not avoid overhearing her say in
the inner room aforesaid, close to the open window of
which our party were clustered, "Oh, nyung missis&mdash;dere
are old massa Frenche&mdash;one tall town-looking
buccra, wid big hook nose like one parrot bill&mdash;one
leetler fat one, hab red face, and one fonny coat, all
tick over wid small silk barrel, and broider wid black
silk lace&mdash;And&mdash;oh, I forgot&mdash;one small slip of a boy,
dat roll side to side so"&mdash;here she seemed to be
suiting the action to the word&mdash;"like de sailor negro."
</p>

<p>
Now this was <i>me</i>, your honour.
</p>

<p>
At this moment we heard a noise, as if some one had
been scraping the mud off his shoes at the back part
of the house, and giving various orders at the same
time in a loud voice to the servants; then a heavy
step through the lofty hall, and enter a tall, sallow,
yellow-snake of a man, in wide white jane trowsers
and waistcoat,&mdash;the perspiration streaming down his
face, and dripping from the point of his sun-peeled
nose, while the collar of his shirt and his neckcloth
were also very sudorous.  He wore a threadbare blue
coat, the buttons all covered with verdigris, and a
hat&mdash;which he kept on, by the way&mdash;worn white at the
edges, with the pasteboard frame of it visible where
the silk nap had been rubbed.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, Frenche," quoth mine host, for it was no
other, "how are you, my dear fellow?  Paul, call
your missis&mdash;and, Mr Twig, I am so glad to see you.
Boys, get second breakfast&mdash;we have kept it back on
purpose."
</p>

<p>
"Twang," thought I.
</p>

<p>
"Frenche, my lad, introduce me&mdash;your nephew, I presume?"
</p>

<p>
I bowed, and was shaken furiously by the hand.
</p>

<p>
"I should have known him, I declare; so like you,
my old cock."
</p>

<p>
"Gammon again," thought I.
</p>

<p>
"And, Twig, I say, you must introduce me to"&mdash;Here
he indicated Don Felix, and prepared to "pull
his foot," as the negroes say, in that direction
also&mdash;in other words, to make his bow to Monsieur Flamingo,
who was accordingly made known to him in due form,
and had his fingers nearly wrung off, as mine had been.
Don Felix, so soon as he was released, took an
opportunity of catching my eye, shaking them aside, and
blowing the tips as if they had been burned.
</p>

<p>
The ladies now appeared&mdash;our hostess, really a splendid
woman, and her daughter, fresh off the irons from
a fashionable English boarding-school, a very pretty
girl, but suffering under prickly heat (a sort of a
what-do-ye-call-um, a kind of Jamaica imitation, but
deucedly like 'tother thing in Scotland notwithstanding); and
the plague of freckles&mdash;ods bobs, how I do hate
freckles!&mdash;where was I&mdash;oh&mdash;so our lunch, or second
breakfast, was really a very pleasant one.  From that
time until dinner, we talked, and read, and played
bagatelle, and amongst other means employed to kill
time, Miss Cornstick was set to play on the piano.
She was, I make no doubt, a first-rate performer, and
<i>spanged</i> her fingers from the keys as if they had been
red hot iron, and tossed her head about as she sung,
and cast her eyes towards the roof as if she had seen
something rather surprising there.
</p>

<p>
"That's what I call singing with animation, at all
events; oh, how I wish the pedals were mine
enemies," whispered Don Felix.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, how missie <i>do</i> sing&mdash;how him do play on de
pinano&mdash;wery extonishing fine," quoth the brown
ladies' maid <i>sotto voce</i>, behind the open door of the
anteroom, but loud enough for me to overhear.
</p>

<p>
However, allow for some few trifling peculiarities
of this kind, and we had every reason to be exceedingly
pleased with our entertainment; for we had a capital
dinner, and some superb Madeira, and the evening
passed over delightfully on the whole.
</p>

<p>
When we came to retire, I was shown to my sleeping
apartment, a small room partitioned off from the
end of the piazza; that is, altogether <i>without</i> the brick
shell of the house itself.
</p>

<p>
I had proceeded in disrobing, and was about putting
out the candle, when I heard a "cheep, cheep,"
overhead, as of a mouse in the paws of pussy.  I looked
up, and lo! an owl, perched on what seemed a shelf,
that ran along the wall overhead, with mousey sure
enough in his beak.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo," said I, "Master Owl, this will never do;
you must make yourself scarce, my boy," and I seized
a fishing-rod that happened to stand in the corner of
the room&mdash;"there, take that, your owlship," and I made
a blow at him with the but-end, but missed; however
it had the effect of startling him off his perch, and with
a loud <i>squake</i>, he took wing round the room.  The
first consequence of his vagary was the extinction of
the light, whereby he got the weather-gage of me
regularly, for although he could not see <i>in the light</i>,
he saw beautifully <i>in the darkness</i>, and avoided my
haphazard blows most scientifically.  At length,
amongst other feats of skill, and evidences of composure,
I fractured the <i>monkey</i>, or earthen water-jar that
garnished my toilet table, and finally capsized over the
steps at the bedside, to the great loss of the skin
on my shinbone, and the large effusion of my patience.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jinker, Jinker!" I could hear a door open.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Jinker," said a man's voice,&mdash;"what noise
is that in the piazza, in the name of wonder?"
</p>

<p>
<i>Snore&mdash;snort&mdash;yawn</i>.  "Can't tell, massa,"
replied the negro domestic, who was thus roused from
his lair in the piazza, "but I will go see de sound,
what it is, massa."
</p>

<p>
"You will," thought I, as I heard him groping and
grumbling all about&mdash;"What naise is dat?&mdash;my
fader&mdash;what a knock my nose take again dat post him&mdash;mi
say, what naise dat is?" quoth Quashie, more
than half asleep&mdash;"Nobody hanswer?  Me say de tird
time, what naise, eh?"
</p>

<p>
I had gathered myself into bed the best way I
could, but the owl continued his gyrations round and
round the room, and here gave another <i>screech</i>.  "Ha,"
said Jinker, "creech howl, massa&mdash;creech howl."
</p>

<p>
"Screech owl!" rejoined Mr Cornstick, for it was
he who had spoken; "how the deuce can a screech owl
upset chairs, smash the crockery, and make such an
infernal to do as that?  Get a light, sir."
</p>

<p>
All this while I was like to choke with laughter.
"Jinker," said I, "bring a light here, and don't alarm
the family.  Tell Mr Cornstick it is only an owl that
has got, I can't tell how, into my room&mdash;nothing
more."  I heard Mr Cornstick laugh at this, and say
a word of comfort to Mrs Cornstick, as I supposed,
and she again began to console a <i>wee skirling</i> Cornstick,
that I concluded was their bedfellow, and then
shut the door.
</p>

<p>
Creak&mdash;another door opened&mdash;"Diana!" said
Miss Cornstick, in great alarm&mdash;"Good gracious!
what is <i>all</i> that, Diana?"
</p>

<p>
"Noting, misses, but one fight between de leetle
sailor buccra and one howl."
</p>

<p>
"So, here's a mess!  The whole Cornstick family&mdash;men,
women, and children&mdash;set alive and kicking in
the dead of night, by me and my uninvited visitor!"
</p>

<p>
Presently Jinker appeared with a lighted candle,
but by this time the owl was nowhere to be seen.
</p>

<p>
"How him get away, massa?  I no see him."
</p>

<p>
No more did I.  We continued our search.
</p>

<p>
"Him cannot possib have creep troo de keyhole."
</p>

<p>
"I should rather think not," said I; "but there he
was, perched up in that corner, when I first saw him.
He was sitting on that very shelf.  Where the deuce
can the creature have stowed himself?"
</p>

<p>
"Shelf!" said the negro; "shelf!  What shelf, massa?"
</p>

<p>
"That one there; isn't it a shelf?"
</p>

<p>
"Shelf!  O no, massa, it is de gutter dat lead de
rain from de roof of de house dat come along here
under de eaves of de shingle, you know, and den pour
him into one larsh barrel outside; but tap"&mdash;&mdash;Here
Jinker got on the table, to inspect the lay of the land
more perfectly.  "Ah, I see; he hab come in and go
out troo de guttering, sure enough"&mdash;(a square
uncovered trough).  "He must have nest hereabout,
massa."
</p>

<p>
"But how shall we <i>keep</i> him out," said I, "now
since he is out?"
</p>

<p>
"Tap, I shall show you.  Give me up one on dem
towel, please, massa.  I will tuff him into de hole till
daybroke."
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, but you shall not do <i>that</i> thing; none of
your stopping the gutter.  Why, only suppose it should
rain in the night, Snowball&mdash;eh?  Would it not
overflow, my beauty?  You don't want to drown me, do
you?"
</p>

<p>
"Massa, no fear of dat&mdash;none at all; de moon clear
and hard as one bone; and de star, dem twinkle sharp
and bright as one piece broken glass when de sun
shine on him.  No, no, all dry, dry&mdash;no rain before
morning.  Rain! dere shan't be no rain for one mont."
</p>

<p>
"But I am not inclined to take your word for this,
my lad; so"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Bery well, massa; bery good&mdash;massa know betterest;
so, since massa want howl for bedfellow, Jinker
can't help it&mdash;only massa had better put someting over
him face to cover him nose, or him yeye&mdash;basin will
do&mdash;oh, howl love piece of de nose of one nyung
buccra bery mosh."
</p>

<p>
Come, thought I, sleeping with a basin on one's face
is too absurd after all; but better even that than be
drowned&mdash;"So, friend Jinker,"&mdash;I was now resolved&mdash;"since
<i>that</i> is your name, <i>stop</i> the hole you <i>shall
not</i>; therefore, jink out of the room, will ye, for I am
very drowsy."
</p>

<p>
I fell asleep, but the notion of this said conduit
leading through my room haunted me.  At one moment
I dreamed I heard the rain beating on the roof of the
house, and against the blinds; and the next the
rushing, and rippling, and gurgling of the water along the
hollow wooden pipe; then I was wafted by the
<i>sound</i>&mdash;there's a poetical image for you&mdash;to the falls of
Niagara, and was standing in the cave of Eolus, with
the strong damp gusts of cold wind eddying and
whirling around me, as if it would have lifted me off my
feet on the wings of my shirt&mdash;for mind I had no other
garment on&mdash;below the Great Horseshoe fall, with the
screen of living waters falling, green and foam-streaked,
like a sheet of flowing-glass, past my eyes, down
down, down&mdash;and boiling away into the Devil's Pot
under foot.  Anon the sparkling veil of water was bent
towards me, until it touched the tip of my nose, and I
turned to escape; but the basin on my face prevented
my seeing.  But this again soon became transparent,
as if the coarse delf had been metamorphosed into clear
crystal, and down thundered the cascade again&mdash;for it
had ceased for a moment, you must know&mdash;sprinkled
this time with draggle-winged owls, as thick as
Bonaparte's coronation robe with bees.  I was choked,
suffocated, and all the rest of it.  "Murder!  Murder!&mdash;I
am drowned&mdash;I am drowned&mdash;for ever and entirely
drowned!" and in an agony of fear I struggled to
escape, but in vain&mdash;in vain&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The waters gather'd o'er me!"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
when enter friend Jinker&mdash;"Massa, massa, who hurt
you?  Who kill you?  Who <i>ravage</i> you?"
</p>

<p>
Bash; something wet, and cold, and feathery flew
against my face&mdash;"Oh, gemini, what is this next!
Lights&mdash;lights&mdash;lights&mdash;my kingdom for a
farthing-candle!"
</p>

<p>
"Will massa only be pleased to sit down on de bed
and be quiet one moment?" said my sable friend.
</p>

<p>
I did so; and beginning to breathe&mdash;for the falls
of Niagara had now ceased&mdash;I rubbed my eyes, and
lo! the blessed sun shone brightly through the lattice
just opened by Jinker, and out flew the owl with a
loud screech, more happy to escape than I was to get
quit of him apparently; and flying as a drunken man
walks, zig-zag, up and down, against trees and bushes,
until it landed in a pimento-tree about pistol-shot
from the house, where he gave a wild "Hoo, hoo,
hoo," as if he had said, "Thank my stars, I have found
rest to the sole of my foot at last."
</p>

<p>
But such a scene as the room presented!  Notwithstanding
friend Jinker's prognostication, there <i>had
been</i> a heavy shower, and the bed was deluged with
dirty water&mdash;the green matter from the shingles
discolouring all the sheets&mdash;while from the flooded floor
the water was soaking through the seams, and drip
dripping on the dry ground below, like a shower-bath.&mdash;"Now,
dat howl! him do it all, massa," quoth Jinker,
"sure as can be."
</p>

<p>
"Don't you think the rain had somewhat to do
with it too, Jinker?"  But Jinker was deaf as a post.
</p>

<p>
"Here, you see, when you trike at him, he drap
mouse&mdash;dere him lie dead on de table; so he come
back when you sleep, and no doubt after de rain
begin, for see de fedder tick on de nail in de gutter, and
de howl must hab been tick in de hole, and choke de
water back, and"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here Quashie caught a glimpse of my disconsolate
physiognomy, all drenched and forlorn.  It was too
much for him; so, forgetting all his manners, he burst
into a long and loud laugh.  However, no serious
damage was done; and at breakfast there was not a
little fun at my expense.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
It turned out that our entertainer, and his wife and
daughter, were bound on a visit this forenoon to some
neighbour; so, as our roads lay together so far, we all
started after breakfast in company.  I was a good deal
amused at the change in the outward <i>wo</i>man of my
<i>ladies maid</i>, the handsome brown girl in the gay gown
already mentioned, who now appeared stripped of her
plumes, without stockings or shoes, in her Osnaburg
chemise, and coarse blue woollen petticoat&mdash;the latter
garment shortened, like the tunic of her namesake
Diana, by a handkerchief tied tightly round her waist,
just over the hips, exhibiting the turn of her lower
spars to considerably above the knee&mdash;with a large
bandbox on her head covered with oilskin, and a good
cudgel in her hand.  I asked Mr Cornstick how far
they were going.  He answered it was a ride of fifteen
miles, and, in the same breath, he called out to the
brown damsel, "Say we shall be there by second
breakfast time, Diana."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, massa."
</p>

<p>
"Mind we don't get there before you."
</p>

<p>
"No fear of dat, massa," said the silvan goddess,
smiling, as she struck off through the woods at a pace
that would have pleased Captain Barclay exceedingly.
It appeared that she was to take a short cut across the
hills.
</p>

<p>
"How can that girl <i>trust</i> her naked limbs in such a
brake?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Why not, don't you see she is a <i>chased</i> goddess?"
said Don Felix.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Flamingo, I verily believe you will peck at
a grain of mustard-seed next," quoth friend Twig.
</p>

<p>
We started; Mrs Cornstick on a stout pony, with
the head servant, Mark Antony, by name, but as ugly
a flat-nosed <i>nigger</i> as Christian could desire to clap
eyes on by <i>nature</i>, holding on by its tail.  Then came
Miss Cornstick on <i>her</i> palfrey, with a similar pendant,
but her page was a fine handsome mulatto boy; while
we brought up the rear&mdash;the whole cavalcade being
closed by the mounted servants.  By and by, the road
being good, although mountainous, we spanked along
at a smart rate, and it was then that the two fellows
pinned to the ladies' tails&mdash;the tails of their ponies, I
beg pardon&mdash;showed their paces in a most absurd
fashion, making great flying strides at every step, so
as to keep time with the canter of the quadrupeds.
They looked like two dancing-masters gone mad.  I
thought of Cutty Sark clutching the tail of Tam
O'Shanter's grey mare Meg.
</p>

<p>
"Do you see that humming-bird?" said Jacob
Twig, who was giving me a cast in his curricle&mdash;Flamingo
having changed into my uncle's gig.  Crack&mdash;he
knocked it down on the wing with his whip, as it
hovered over some flowers on the roadside.  "That's
what I call a good shot now."
</p>

<p>
"Ah, but a very cruel one," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Sorry for it&mdash;shan't do it again, Mr Brail."
</p>

<p>
"Safe in that," thought I.
</p>

<p>
On coming to a cross-road, the Cornsticks struck off
to the left, and, saying good-by, we stood on our course.
</p>

<p>
Nothing particular occurred until we were descending
the hill into St Thomas in the Vale.  The sun was
shining brightly without a cloud.  The jocund breeze
was rushing through the trees, and dashing their masses
of foliage hither and thither; turning up the
silvery undersides of the leaves at one moment, and then
changing their hues into all shades of green the next.
The birds were glancing and chirping amongst the
branches.  The sleek cattle were browsing lazily and
contentedly on the slope of the hill; and the merry
negro gangs were shouting and laughing at their
work&mdash;but the vulture was soaring over all in pride of
place; eagle-like, far up in the clear blue firmament,
as if the abominable bird had been the genius of the
yellow fever, hovering above the fair face of nature,
ready to stoop and blast it.
</p>

<p>
The sky gradually darkened&mdash;all cloudless as it was&mdash;for
there was not a shred of vapour floating in its
pure depths so big as the hand of the servant of the
prophet.  The gloom increased&mdash;not that kind of
twilight that precedes the falling of the
night&mdash;but a sort of lurid purple hue that began mysteriously
to pervade the whole atmosphere, as if we had been
looking forth on the landscape through a piece of glass
stained with smoke.
</p>

<p>
"Heyday," said Felix, "what's the matter?  I see
no clouds, yet the sun is overcast.  It increases;"&mdash;the
oxen on the hill sides turned and looked over their
shoulders with a puzzled look, as if they did not know
what to make of it, no more than ourselves&mdash;"Can't
be time to go home to take our night spell in that
weary mill yet, surely?"
</p>

<p>
The large carrion crows rapidly declined in their
flight, narrowing their sweeping circles gradually, until
they pirouetted down, and settled, with outstretched
wings, on the crags above us; startling forth half a
dozen bats, and a slow sailing owl, the latter fluttering
about as if scarcely awake, and then floating away
steadily amongst the bushes, as if he had said&mdash;"Come,
it must be the <i>gloaming</i> after all&mdash;so here goes for
mousey."
</p>

<p>
The negroes suddenly intermitted the chipping and
tinkling of their hoes, and the gabbling of their
tongues, as they leant on the shanks of the former,
and looked up.  "Heigh, wurra can be come over de
daylight, and no shell blow yet?"[<a id="chap09fn1text"></a><a href="#chap09fn1">1</a>]
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap09fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn1text">1</a>] The gangs are turned in at dinner-time by the sounding of a
conch shell.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We now perceived the chirping of insects and reptiles
that usually prevails, during the hours of night in
the West Indies, begin to breeze up.  First a lizard
would send forth a solitary whistle, as much as to say,
"It can't be night yet surely?"  Then, from the
opposite side of the way, another would respond, with a low
startled "<i>wheetle wheetle</i>," which might be interpreted,
"Indeed but it is though;" and on this, as if there
had been no longer any doubt about the matter, the
usual concert of crickets, beetles, lizards, and tree toads,
buzzed away as regularly as if it had indeed been evening
in very truth.
</p>

<p>
"An eclipse of the sun," said I, and sure enough so
it was; for in half an hour it gradually lightened again,
and every thing became once more as bright and
cheery, and everyday-like as before.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at Bogwalk tavern to dinner, where we
found a grand party of the officers of the regiment of
foot militia, and also of the troop.  The general
commanding the district had reviewed them that morning,
and was to have dined with them, but for some
reason or another he had to return to Spanish Town
immediately after the review.  It was a formidable
thing meeting so many red coats and gay laced blue
jackets; and, of course, I was much gratified to learn,
that the brown company fired remarkably well&mdash;how
steadily the grenadiers passed in review&mdash;and how
soldier-like Captain M'&mdash;&mdash;, who commanded the light
horse, had given the word of command.
</p>

<p>
"How thoroughly your horse is broke now, Mac.,"
said a tall man, with a nose like a
powder-horn&mdash;"steady as a rock, and such courage!"
</p>

<p>
"Courage!" rejoined Captain Mac., "he would
charge up to the mouth of a cannon."
</p>

<p>
"Ay," whispered Flamingo to me, "if a bag of corn
were hung on the muzzle."
</p>

<p>
We started early, as the night fell, and arrived in
Spanish Town the same evening; and next day were
comfortably domiciled in Squire Flamingo's mansion
in Kingston.
</p>

<p>
It was the race week, and the town had gathered all
the fashion of the island&mdash;nothing could be gayer.
</p>

<p>
Our friend Twig had several running horses, and
altogether the bare-legged black jockeys, with the
stirrup-irons held between their toes, parrot fashion, and
the slight thorough-bred things they rode, acquitted
themselves extremely well; besides, we had matches
amongst the officers of the garrison, and theatricals,
and pig races, and I don't know what all.
</p>

<p>
Speaking of theatricals, if you will wait a moment I
will tell you of an amusing playhouse row that I
happened to witness, and wherein my friend Flamingo
and myself bore conspicuous parts <i>by mistake</i>.
</p>

<p>
It happened to be an amateur performance, and we
had just seated ourselves in the second row of a buccra
box, near the stage.
</p>

<p>
I was admiring the neatness of the house, which was
great for a provincial theatre any where, and the
comical appearance the division of castes produced, as
thus:&mdash;The pit seemed to be almost exclusively filled
with the children of Israel, as peculiar in their national
features here as everywhere else; the dress boxes
contained the other white inhabitants and their families;
the second tier the brown <i>ladies</i>, who seemed more
intent on catching the eyes of the young buccras
<i>below</i>, than attending to the civil things the males of
their own shade were pouring into their ears <i>above</i>;
the gallery was tenanted by Bungo himself, in all his
glory of black face, blubber lips, white eyes, and ivory
teeth.  This black parterre being powdered here and
there with a sprinkling of white sailors, like
snowdrops in a bed of purple anemones; Jack being, as
usual on such occasions, pretty well drunk.
</p>

<p>
A very nice-looking fresh complexioned little man
was sitting on the same bench along with us on the
right hand&mdash;that is, next the stage&mdash;and a young
stray Hebrew, having eschewed the pit, sat on our
left&mdash;we were thus between them&mdash;a post of no small
danger, as it turned out.  There had been some
wrangling between these parties before we entered, for no
sooner had Flamingo and I taken our seats, than
Moses said <i>across us</i>, but, as it afterwards appeared,
intending to address the <i>gentleman already mentioned</i>,
"If you say that again, sir, I will pull your nose."
</p>

<p>
Thereupon, up rose the <i>short</i> ruddy man, and up
rose the <i>long</i> Don Felix, each appropriating the insult
to himself; but Flam, who never dreamed that any
nose could be spoken of when his own kidney potato
was in company, was first, and levelled little Moses in
an instant.  This was the signal for the sea of Jews in
the pit to toss its billows; and, like a great cauldron,
to popple and hiss, until it boiled over into the boxes,
in a roaring torrent, that speedily overthrew both Don
Felix, the little ruddy man, and <i>I Benjie</i>, who had
neither part nor portion in the quarrel, <i>into the
bargain</i>; and such a pommelling I never got before or
since.
</p>

<p>
Whatever Moses's creed might have been, he spared
not my <i>bacon</i> that blessed night, as my poor ribs
witnessed for many a long day.
</p>

<p>
In the midst of the uproar, a magistrate&mdash;a most
excellent and sedate personage&mdash;planted his back
against the pillar, immediately behind me, where a
cohort of parrot bills had already turned the flank of the
brave little red man, and were threatening my own
rear, left uncovered by the destruction of both of my
coat skirts.  Here he shouted at the top of his pipe to
"keep the peace;" but one of the assailants, a
powerful bluebeard, speedily gagged <i>him</i>, by passing his
arm round his neck, and pinning him to the post, as if
he had been a culprit undergoing the Spanish
punishment of the <i>garrote</i>.
</p>

<p>
At length the row became so serious and <i>national</i>,
that the whole house was likely to side with one or
other of the parties; the manager, therefore, fearing for
the safety of his theatre, sent for the chief magistrate
in town (not the mayor, who was absent), and he
fortunately made his appearance very promptly, with a
party of police; the row on this was fast subsiding,
until a very ludicrous incident made it breeze up again
with twofold violence, like flax steeped in turpentine
cast on a smouldering fire.  For the last ten minutes
Don Felix had disappeared, having been literally
trodden down, after a fall on missing his blow at the
Goliah who led the assault; and when the storm abated,
and he could screw himself from under the benches
where he had been forced, the first thing he did, in
his haste and confusion, was <i>to throttle the very man
of authority himself</i>; taking him for one of the enemy.
The tumult again increased on this, and we now ran
some chance of being extinguished altogether; for
a gigantic black-whiskered Israelite had upheaved a
stick, which threatened to prove the thickness of my
skull, had there been any doubt about it, when I was
saved by the timely succour afforded by a powerful
sailor-looking chap, who had fought his way towards
us, clearing a path right and left amongst our enemies,
like a walking windmill.
</p>

<p>
"Foul, foul&mdash;stick against fist&mdash;fair play is a jewel,"
sung out the windmill, whom, it flashed on me at the
moment, I had seen before, and suiting the action to
the word, he seized him of the black whisker and
parrot nose, neck and croup, and pitched him down bodily
into the thickest of the troubled waters of the pit, as
if he had been a juvenile branch of the grunter
family&mdash;not pig upon pork, however, but Jew upon Jew,
where he floundered on the sea of heads for a minute,
like a harpooned whale come to the surface to breathe,
and then sank, to have his ribs very sufficiently
kneaded by the knees and feet of his rebellious compatriots.
</p>

<p>
Having accomplished this feat, the sailor, as if desirous
of escaping observation, slid out of the <i>mêlée</i>, and
I lost sight of him.
</p>

<p>
The fight continued, but the police were by this
time masters; and fortunately we were taken into
custody, and bailed by our friends.  Next day we
escaped with a fine.
</p>

<p>
At breakfast Twig was comforting us.  "Poo, poo&mdash;never
mind&mdash;it was all a mistake&mdash;all a mistake, you know."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," quoth Don Felix, "but my ribs are not the
less sore; no mistake there I assure you."
</p>

<p>
"And the skirts of my coat," said I.
</p>

<p>
But to return to the races.  On one occasion, a
certain Captain Jack Straw, master of one of the
London ships, and the collector of the customs, were two
of Flamingo's guests at dinner, and a match was made
between them, to come off next morning.
</p>

<p>
It was given out to be a trial of bottom, as they
were to ride six times round the race course.  Now the
latter was a measured mile; a six-mile heat, thought
I, in such a climate, and the owners to ride!
However, there was nothing more said about it, and I had
forgotten it, until Mr Flamingo took me out in his
Stanhope at daybreak the next morning to see the
racers sweated; and there, the first thing that met our
eyes was old Straw sure enough, with his hat tied
under his chin by a red bandana, and his trowsers
shuffled up to his knees, ambling along mighty fussily,
on a great chestnut mare, as unlike a race-horse, as one
could well fancy an individual of the same species to
be; for although he <i>appeared</i> to be cantering along,
the pace was so sluggish, that we passed him easily in
a trot.  Those who have seen Ducrow in the Tailor
riding to Brentford, caprioling on the stage as if he
were going fifteen knots an hour, while he never
shoots a single fathom a-head, will form a good idea of
our friend's appearance and style of locomotion.
</p>

<p>
"Well, Jack," cried Flamingo, "how come you on? who wins?"
</p>

<p>
Here the collector came rattling up astern, deucedly
well mounted, standing in his stirrups, his long nose
poked between his horse's ears, and riding, regular
jockey fashion, without his coat, a handkerchief tied
round his head, and his whip crossed in his teeth, and
sawing away with his hands.
</p>

<p>
As he passed the old sailor, he pulled up&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Now, Jack, do give in, and don't boil me to jelly;
you see I have done four rounds of the course, while
you have not completed two.  You must be aware
you have no chance; so give in, and come and
breakfast with me&mdash;do, that's a good fellow."
</p>

<p>
"Give in!" roared Jack, "give in, indeed!  That's
a good one&mdash;why, the old mare's bottom is only
beginning to tell&mdash;give in, Master Collector!&mdash;No,
no&mdash;besides, I see your horse is blown&mdash;there, mind he
don't bolt; give in, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
And thereupon he made a devil of a splutter; heels,
arms, and head all in a fidget, and away shot his
antagonist once more, leaving Jack puffing and bobbing
on his asthmatic mare, up and down, up and down, in
a regular hobby-horsical fashion, as like his own
heavy-sterned ship digging through a head sea on a
bowline, as could well be imagined.
</p>

<p>
However, the collector <i>did</i> win, which honest Jack
had foreseen all along, although the six-mile gallop
had put him into a rare fever; but bearing no malice,
as he said, after handsomely paying the stakes, he
went and breakfasted, according to invitation, with his
conqueror.
</p>

<p>
That day at dinner we met both the equestrians,
when Jack told us with great glee, as one does a good
joke, that his mate had run three pipes of Cognac and
twenty dozen of claret, during the time the coast <i>was
clear</i>, but that he had satisfied his conscience by
sending a case of the latter to the <i>friend</i> he had so cleverly
kept in play, with his compliments, "not to ride races
of six-mile heats again, before breakfast."
</p>

<p>
As we rode up to the course next evening, at four
o'clock, as usual, we were somewhat late, and found
the rope drawn across the ingress at the bottom of the
race ground.  The bugle to saddle had sounded some
time before; so we had to pull up where we were, in
order to see the horses pass.  We were standing with our
horses' heads close to the ropes, when an overseer
of some neighbouring estate rode up, pretty well
primed, and, to our great surprise, charged the
rope, which he did not appear to see.  He was only
trotting his mule, however, and there was no
haste or violence about him; but when the rope
checked the animal, he gave a drunken pitch, but all
as quiet as could be, and toppled over its head quite
gently, as if he had been a sack, into the ride, where,
after making one or two sprawling movements with
his feet, he lay still, with the beast looking at him
from the other side of the rope, and poking down its
head, and snorting and snoking at him.  The next
bugle sounded, the horses were away, and some of the
lookers-on had just time to drag the poor fellow off
the course by the legs, when they passed us like a
whirlwind.
</p>

<p>
"Tree to one on Moses," cried one sable amateur,
for if we had not altogether the <i>style</i> of Newmarket,
it was from no want of <i>Blacklegs</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Six to one on Blue Peter," quoth another ragged neger.
</p>

<p>
"Five to one on Mammy Taws."
</p>

<p>
"Slap Bang against de field."  And all was
anxiety about the race; but no one took any notice of
the poor overseer, who lay still and motionless on the
side of the dry ditch that surrounds the course.
</p>

<p>
At length, seeing the poor creature broiling in the
hot sun, we dismounted to help him up.
</p>

<p>
"Massa," said a negro, taking his arm, "he must
be well dronk dis buccra.  See how him hand drop
again when I lift him&mdash;supple like one new-kill
snake."
</p>

<p>
"Supple enough," said Dr &mdash;&mdash;, who now rode up,
and felt his pulse first, and then his neck.  "Poor
fellow! supple as he is now, he will be soon stark and
stiff enough.  His neck is broken&mdash;<i>that's all</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Neck broken!" said Flamingo and I in a breath,
much shocked.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, and dead as Julius Cæsar.  But, pray, did
you notice if the White Jacket and Black Cap came in?"
</p>

<p>
<i>The man had, in very truth, actually broken his neck</i>.
</p>

<p>
Several evenings after this, I was engaged with a
fishing party, in a canoe, near the top of the harbour,
at a cove where the prizes of the squadron were
usually moored, previous to their being sold.  It was a
very fine evening, and the sun was setting gloriously
in the west&mdash;as where else should he have set?  Our
sport had been very good, and we were thinking of
taking up the grapnel.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Brail," said Flamingo, "let us go and
inspect the Morne Fortunee there."  This was a French
privateer, one of the captured vessels, that lay about
a cable's length from where we were.
</p>

<p>
"Come along, then&mdash;there, string the fish, Twister.
Up anchor, boys, and pull for that brig."
</p>

<p>
As we approached, we saw a man get into a small
skiff that lay alongside, with two black fellows in it,
rather hurriedly, and pull for the shore.
</p>

<p>
The last rays of the evening sun shone brightly
on him, as he passed us, and I had a good squint at
his face.  He gave me a piercing look also, and then
suddenly turned away.
</p>

<p>
"Eh! no, it can't be&mdash;by Mercury, but it is though!
Why, there <i>is</i> the fellow that saved my <i>bacon</i> from
the Jew at the theatre, I declare.  And more than
that, when I piece several floating notions together&mdash;why,
Don Felix, there goes, as large as life, the Master
Wilson of Montego bay."
</p>

<p>
"You don't say so?" quoth Flamingo.  "Stop,
we have four fellows in the boat besides ourselves
and the servant, and here is my gun.  And Quacco
there is an old soldier.  Boys, give way after that
boat&mdash;one dollar, if you beat him."
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah! hurrah for massa!"  And away we shot
after the skiff, which, as yet, was proceeding very
leisurely, so that we rapidly gained on it.  As we came
up within pistol-shot, the chase lay on his oars, and
the person steering looked steadily at us.  I was not so
sure of him now.  He had a deep scar down his left
cheek, which the other had not.
</p>

<p>
"Do you want any thing with me, gentlemen?"  This
simple question fairly posed us.
</p>

<p>
"No&mdash;not&mdash;that is&mdash;pull the starboard oars."  The
last sentence I spoke to the negroes in a whisper, and
the effect of the fulfilment of the order was to bring
the bow of the canoe within a couple of yards of the
broadside of the skiff.  The stranger, at this
suspicious movement, made a sign to his men, who stretched
out with the thews of gladiators.  This broke the ice.
</p>

<p>
"After him, my lads," cried Flamingo.
</p>

<p>
We were now within a quarter of a mile of the
narrow neck of sand that divides the harbour from the
sea, here about fifty yards broad, and not above three
feet high; so that, although the skiff was evidently
heading us, yet we had every prospect of being up in
time to seize the crew before they could haul her across,
and launch her through the surf on the sea-face of the
bank.
</p>

<p>
"There he is ashore.  Murder, how handily the
black fellows walk off with the skiff, as if it were
paper."
</p>

<p>
As Don Felix spoke, we also took the ground, and
he and I jumped out, and pushed after the strangers.
When we got within ten yards of them, the party of
whom I had suspicions turned resolutely, and made a
step towards us.
</p>

<p>
"I do not know to what circumstance I am indebted
for the pleasure of your company, gentlemen,"
said he quite calmly.  "Will you please to make
known your desire?"
</p>

<p>
Here Flamingo, Quacco, and one of the canoe-men
made as if they would pass him, and get between him
and the beach, where his people were in the very act
of launching the skiff through the surf.  When he saw
this, he smiled bitterly, and drew his belt tighter, but
all with the utmost coolness.  He then, as if setting
about some necessary labour, walked up to Quacco, by
far the most powerful of our party, and seizing him
by the throat, dashed him to one side, and a black
fellow to the other, as if they had been children; he
then deliberately walked into the water up to his
waist, clambered into the skiff, and before we could
count twenty, he was pulling right out to sea, without
once looking behind him.
</p>

<p>
"Heave to, or I'll fire at you, by Jupiter!" roared
Don Felix.
</p>

<p>
The stranger still did not deign to look round,
occupying himself in bailing out the water that the skiff
had taken in the shove through the surf.
</p>

<p>
Flamingo repeated the threat, levelling his fowling-piece;
at which our friend slowly held up a bright-barrelled
article, that he took from the bottom of
the boat, more like a swivel than a blunderbuss.
At sight of this, Don Felix dropped his gun as if
the barrel had burned his fingers, whipped both hands
under the skirts of his coat, wheeling round on one
leg at the same time, and drawing himself up to
his full height, and grinning and shutting his eyes,
and slewing his head on one side, as if he had been
trying to present the smallest possible surface to the
pelting of a hail shower.  The stranger, at this, slowly
replaced the weapon, and in a twinkling was out of
gun-shot, pulling towards a schooner lying becalmed
outside of the keys.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Brail, did you see that glancing affair in his
hand?  Was it a carronade, think you, or a long
eighteen-pounder?  Why, it might have doodled our
whole party as regularly as Rory Macgregor did his
own ducks."
</p>

<p>
On returning, we went on board the prize brig,
from which we had startled our friend, and found the
arm-chest on the poop broken open, and the contents
scattered all about the deck, as if the party had been
picking and choosing.
</p>

<p>
"So, so, I see what our honest man has been after,"
said I.
</p>

<p>
There was no prize-keeper on board; and, knowing
this, the visit of the skiff had unquestionably been for
the purpose of purloining arms.
</p>

<p>
"Jackson," said a gentleman at dinner, at the house
where I dined that day, "any further accounts from
windward?"
</p>

<p>
"No; there are two schooners, the Humming Bird
and Sparkle, on the look-out; but no tidings of the
infernal little felucca."
</p>

<p>
"Felucca! felucca!" said I, looking across the
table at Don Felix.  "Pardon me, sir, what felucca
were you speaking of?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, that is more than I can tell you, sir; but
she has plundered three London ships off Morant bay
within this last week; one of them belonging to me,
and in my case the captain and crew were most cruelly
treated; but now, when two men-of-war schooners
are cruising for her, she has vanished like a spectre."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said another of the party; "and the John
Shand was boarded yesterday evening by the same
vessel off Yallahs, and robbed of a chronometer; but
the boarding officer, by way of <i>amende</i>, I suppose,
politely handed the captain the <i>Kingston papers of the
morning</i>."
</p>

<p>
"Ho, ho, Master Wilson," thought I.

<p>
"Cockadoodle doo&mdash;doo&mdash;doo!"  Never was there
such a place as Kingston for the crowing of cocks.
In other countries cocks sleep at night and crow in
the morning, like respectable birds; but here,
confound them, they crow through the whole livelong
night; and, towards daydawn, it is one continuous
stream of cock-crowing all over the town.

<br />
</p>

<p>
Some days after the transaction already related,
Messrs Flamingo and Twig carried me to dine at the
Court-House with the officers on duty with the
militia Christmas guard.  It was an artillery company,
in which Don Felix held a commission, that had the
guard, the captain of which was a very kind, but
roughspun genius.  However, his senior lieutenant,
Jessamy by name, was a perfect contrast to him, and
a deuced handsome fellow; so he made up for it.
Quite a Frenchman in his manners and dress, but, so
far as I could judge, with what is vulgarly called a
"bee in his bonnet."  Nevertheless, he was an
excellent young man at bottom, although his nonsense,
which was rather entertaining at first, became a little
<i>de trop</i> when the bottle began to circulate;&mdash;for
instance, he insisted, after dinner, on showing us the
last Parisian step, and then began to jabber French,
for display, as it were,&mdash;finishing off by asking me
<i>who made my coat</i>.  Now, I cannot endure people
noticing one's externals; so I stared, and gave him
no answer at first; but he pinned me to the wall,&mdash;so
I mentioned my tailor's name&mdash;Stultz.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! the only man in England who can <i>cut</i>; but
the German <i>Schneiders</i> who take root in Paris eclipse
him entirely.  Ah! the German <i>exactitude</i> and
Parisian taste combined!  Nothing like it, Mr Brail&mdash;nothing
like it, my dear sir.  There, what think you
of that fit?" jumping up and showing his back, to
which his garment clung like a sign at a shop-door.
</p>

<p>
I applauded amazingly, as he wriggled himself this
way and that.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo! what's that?" said the captain.
</p>

<p>
"The tocsin, the tocsin&mdash;the fire-bell, as I am a
gentleman," quoth his gay sub.  And sure enough
the church bell was clanging away at a furious rate,
and the fire-engines began to lumber and rattle past;
while the buz in the streets, and the tramp of people
running along the brick-paved piazzas below, told
plainly enough that a fire had actually broken out
somewhere.
</p>

<p>
"Guard, turn out&mdash;guard, turn out!" roared mine
host, full of military ardour.  And the sudden tap of
the drum was followed by a bustle, and heavy trampling,
and the clatter and clash of muskets from the
guard room, showing that the command had been
obeyed with great alacrity.
</p>

<p>
We had been boozing in the Grand-Jury Room,
which was connected with the piazza in front of the
Court-House, or temporary guard-house, by a long
wooden gangway, so that we had to pass the principal
entrance to the latter, before descending to the street,
where the men were mustering.  It seemed that the
jovial train-bands had been making as good use of
their time as we had been doing; for the long table
before the bench, where in term-time the lawyers
used to congregate, was profusely covered with cold
meats, glasses, and wine-decanters.
</p>

<p>
We were a good deal surprised to see a large earthen
pipkin, about five feet high, used to hold water, that
had been taken from the drip, or filter-stone frame,
where it usually stood in a corner, now planted in the
middle of the floor, with (of all things in the world)
a red, drunken face sticking out of it, crowned with a
hat and feather.  This was one of the invincibles, who
had been made drunk, and then thrust into it by his
comrades; and he must have found his quarters
somewhat of the dampest, for the vessel was more than
half full, as we could hear, from the splashing of the
culprit's limbs.  In his struggles, presently he upset
it, and rolled about on the floor, with the water
gushing and gurgling out at his neck; while he kept
shouting that they had changed the liquor on him.
</p>

<p>
There could be no fault found with the zeal and
promptitude with which the gallant bombardiers <i>fell</i>
in; but I am sorry to say that more than one of them
very speedily <i>fell</i> out, or rather tumbled out; for I
cannot speak so favourably of their steadiness under arms
as I could wish.  It was no doubt a time of profound
quietness and peace, so that some relaxation of the rules
and articles of war was allowable; for the negroes were
thinking of nothing but fun and dancing, and those
Christmas guards were more a matter of form, or to
air the young officers' gay uniforms, than any thing
else.  Our gallant captain himself was not quite so
staid in his carriage at this time as the Archbishop of
Canterbury usually is in the House of Lords, as his
mode of carrying on speedily evinced; first, of all
absurdities in the world, he chose to open the campaign
by making a speech to his men, concluding with
"England expects every man to do his duty."&mdash;"Now,
men&mdash;let us proceed to <i>buzziness</i>" (what a
mouthful he took of the word, to be sure).  "Shoulder
arms."  Up went the firelocks to the shoulders of
the tipsy heroes, very <i>promiscuously</i>, as Jonathan says.
He then gave the word to "fix bayonets."  Now, to
those who understand the setting of a squadron in the
field, to obey <i>this</i> was a physical impossibility to <i>men</i>
who were standing with their muskets <i>shouldered</i>,
whatever it might have been to <i>monkeys</i>.
</p>

<p>
The captain, <i>hearing</i> there was something wrong,
from the clatter of men and muskets, for it was pitch
dark, called out&mdash;"Are all your bayonets fixed?"
</p>

<p>
"The devil a one of them," said a drunken voice;
"nor can be, unless you send for a ladder&mdash;or, and
<i>it would be the cheapest plan probably</i>, tell us to
order arms again."
</p>

<p>
Of the two alternatives, the last was chosen; the
muskets were ordered, and the bayonets at length
fixed; but all this, and the difficulty of getting the
squad under weigh in any thing like tolerable marching
order, took up time; and, from the dying away of
the uproar in the distance, it seemed to me that before
we got through with our manoeuvres the fire might be
out, and the necessity for the display of so much skill
and courage have passed over.
</p>

<p>
"Double quick time&mdash;march;&mdash;now scull along, ye
devils, or the fire will be out," sung out the captain;
and away we raced in single file.
</p>

<p>
The negroes are always most active on occasions of
this kind, and as every householder is obliged to have a
certain number of leathern fire buckets always in
readiness hung in some accessible place, <i>pro bono publico</i>,
with his name painted on them, they had as usual
armed themselves with them on the present occasion;
so we soon came to a double line of black fellows,
extending from the scene of the fire to a public well,
down one file of which the empty buckets were being
handed, while the full ones circulated upwards to the
fire engines by the other.
</p>

<p>
The poor fellows were so busy and zealous that they
did not immediately make an opening for the head of
our gay column.  But we were not to be stopped by
trifles; so&mdash;"Charge bayonets, men, and clear your
own way," sung out the captain.  The leading file did
so; but, as the devil would have it, so did the files in
the rear, whereby every man gave his file leader a most
sufficing progue.  A general stumble and grumble took
place upon this.
</p>

<p>
"Mind your bayonet, sir."
</p>

<p>
"My eye! you have stuck me in the shoulder."
</p>

<p>
"Murder! you have piqued me, I don't know where."
</p>

<p>
At length down tumbled the brave bombardier who
was leading the forlorn hope; and away went the
others helter-skelter on the top of him; Quashie giving
a sly dash of his bucket over the sprawling mass of
fallen militaires every now and then, just to cool their
ardour.  However, they soon gathered themselves up
again, and Flamingo, who was the junior lieutenant,
now brought up the rear, with me, Benjie, alongside
of him.  He was quite sober, so far as appearances
went, but determined to have some fun, I could see.
The fire had been in a narrow lane at the top of the
town, and was by this time got under, as I expected.
Notwithstanding, away we tramped, and were advancing
up the lane, when we saw the glare of flambeaux,
and heard all the confusion and uproar usually
attendant on a fire.  There was an engine planted right in
front of us, at a crossing, that was still playing on the
house that had been burning.  It was directed by a
drunken Irish carpenter, who saw us well enough, I
am persuaded; for the moment he thought he had the
Spartan band within the play of his pipe, he let fly;
and drenched every man and officer as they came up&mdash;all
but Flamingo, who had drawn me into a doorway
until the shower blew over.
</p>

<p>
"Stop, sir; stop your infernal machine," roared the
captain.
</p>

<p>
Whiz&mdash;whiz&mdash;whiz&mdash;splash&mdash;splash&mdash;splutter, was
the only answer.
</p>

<p>
"Advance and storm the battery, men;" and,
drawing his sword, he led them to the attack, like a
hero as he was; receiving the fire (water, I mean) of
the engine full in his face, in all its force and fury, as
he advanced, which knocked off his hat, and nearly
choked him.
</p>

<p>
At length the engine was captured, when the fellow
in charge made a thousand apologies.  "May the
devil burn me," said he, "if I did not take the sparkle
of the officers' gorgets, and the flash of the bayonets,
for a new outbreak of the fire."
</p>

<p>
However, there was now no use for any farther
military demonstration; so we countermarched, like a
string of water-rats, to the Court-House, to console
ourselves with hot negus and deviled biscuit.  A blind
man could have traced the party by the watery trail
they left on the dry sandy street.
</p>

<p>
After this we spent a most jovial fortnight, but the
time of our departure at length arrived.  Poor
Jessamy, the gay artilleryman above spoken of, was one of
a party at our farewell dinner at Flamingo's, two
evenings before we intended to start on our return
home.  He appeared out of spirits, and left the first
of the whole company.  Next day, it seemed, he had
taken an early dinner alone, and ridden out no one
could tell where.  In the evening he did not return to
his lodgings; but still no alarm was taken.  On the
morrow, however, when he did not make his appearance
at his place of business, his friends became
alarmed; especially as it was found that one of the
pistols in his pistol-case had been taken away.
</p>

<p>
My uncle was very desirous of postponing his departure
until the poor young fellow had been accounted
for, as he was a favourite of his; but matters at
home pressed, and we were obliged to return.  Accordingly,
we left our kind friends in Kingston next day
at early dawn, on a most beautiful, clear, cool morning
in January.  No one who has not luxuriated in it,
can comprehend the delights of a West India climate
at this season.  Except at high noon, the air was
purity itself.  Our road home lay through the Liguania,
or rather Saint George's mountains, as we had a short
visit to pay in the latter parish to an old friend of Mr
Frenche.
</p>

<p>
It was about nine in the morning; we had
breakfasted at the Hope tavern, and proceeded three or
four miles on our homeward journey, when a Kingston
gentleman of our acquaintance, accompanied by
an overseer of one of the neighbouring estates,
overtook us, but did not pull up, merely giving us a salute
as he rode quickly past us.
</p>

<p>
"Our friend is in a hurry this morning," said mine uncle.
</p>

<p>
We rode on, and shortly after saw the same horsemen
coming back again, with an addition to their party
of another equestrian.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Mr Frenche," said the Kingston gentleman,
"did you see a saddle-horse without a rider as you
came along?"'
</p>

<p>
"Yes I did.  I saw a good-looking bay cob down
on the hill side, close to the gully there; but I thought
his owner could not be far off, so I paid little regard to it."
</p>

<p>
"God bless me! it must be poor Jessamy's horse;
where can he be?"
</p>

<p>
"Is it known what has become of Mr Jessamy?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"We can't tell, we can't tell; but he has been
traced in this direction, and it must have been his horse
you saw; he has not been heard of since the day
before yesterday at dinner-time."
</p>

<p>
We knew this; but still had hoped he would have
been accounted for by this time.  My uncle was a good
deal moved at this, for the poor young fellow was well
known to him, as already hinted.
</p>

<p>
"I will turn back with you," said he, "and point
out whereabouts the horse was seen.  But I hope
your fears will prove groundless after all."
</p>

<p>
The gentleman shook his head mournfully, and,
after retrograding about a mile, we again caught sight
of the animal we were in search of, eating his grass
composedly below us, on the brink of the rocky
mountain stream.
</p>

<p>
Close by, in a nook or angle of the mountain, and
right below us, was a clump of noble trees, surrounding
an old ruinous building, and clustered round a
wild cotton one, beneath whose shadow the loftiest
English oak would have shrunk to a bush.  Embraced by
two of the huge armlike limbs of the leafy monarch,
and blending its branches gracefully, as if clinging for
support, grew a wide-spreading star-apple; its leaves, of
the colour of the purple beech, undulating gently in
the sea-breeze, upturned their silvery undersides to
the sun, contrasting beautifully with the oak-like
foliage of the cotton-tree.  Half a dozen turkey buzzards,
the Jamaica vulture, were clustered in the star apple-tree,
with a single bird perched as a sentry on the
topmost branch of the giant to which it clung; while
several more were soaring high overhead, diminished
in the depths of the blue heaven to minute specks, as
if they scented the prey afar off.
</p>

<p>
The ruin we saw had been an old Spanish chapel,
and a number of the fruit-trees had no doubt been
planted by the former possessors of the land.  Never
was there a more beautiful spot; so sequestered, no
sound being heard in the vicinity but the rushing of
the breeze through the highest branches of the trees;
for every thing slept motionless and still down below
in the cool checkering shadow and sleepy sunlight
where we were&mdash;the gurgling of the stream, that
sparkled past in starlike flashes, and the melancholy
lowing of the kine on the hillside above.  When the
Kingston gentleman first saw the "John Crows," as
they are called, he exchanged glances with my uncle,
as much as to say, "Ah! my worst fears are about
being realized."  We rode down the precipitous bank
by a narrow path&mdash;so narrow indeed, that the bushes
through which we had to thrust ourselves met over
our saddle-bows&mdash;and soon arrived in the rocky bed of
the stream, where the rotten and projecting bank of
the dry mould that composed the consecrated nook,
overhung us, as we scrambled, rattling and sliding
amongst the slippery and smooth rolled stones of the
gully; while we were nearly unhorsed every now and
then by the bare roots projecting from the bank, where
it had been undermined when the stream had been
swollen.
</p>

<p>
We had to dismount, and the first thing we saw on
scrambling up the bank was a pair of vultures,[<a id="chap09fn2text"></a><a href="#chap09fn2">2</a>] who
jumped away, with outspread wings, a couple of yards
from the edge of it, the moment we put our heads up,
holding their beaks close to the short green sward,
and hissing like geese.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap09fn2"></a>
[<a href="#chap09fn2text">2</a>] Nothing can be conceived more hideous than the whole aspect
of these abominable birds.  They are of the size of a large turkey,
but much stronger, and of a sooty brown.  Their feathers are
never sleek or trimmed, but generally staring, like those of a
fowl in the pip, and not unfrequently covered with filth and blood,
so that their approach is made known by an appeal to more senses
than one.  The neck and head are entirely naked of feathers, and
covered with a dingy red and wrinkled skin.  They are your only
West India scavengers, and are protected by a penalty of fifteen
dollars for every one that is intentionally killed.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
As we advanced, they retired into the small thicket,
and we followed them.  I never can forget the scene
that here opened on our view.
</p>

<p>
The fruit-trees, amongst which I noticed the orange,
lemon, lime, and shaddock, intermingled with the
kennip, custard-apple, bread-fruit, and mango, relieved at
intervals by a stately and minaret-looking palm, formed
a circle about fifty feet in diameter; the open space
being covered, with the exception hereafter mentioned,
with short emerald green grass; in the very centre
of this area stood the ruin, overshadowed by the two
trees already described.  It was scarcely distinguishable
from a heap of green foliage, so completely was it
overrun with the wild yam and wild fig-tree; the latter
lacing and interlacing over the grey stones with its
ligneous fret-work; in some places the meshes
composed of boughs as thick as a man's arm, in others as
minute as those of a small seine, all the links where
the fibres crossed having grown into each other.
</p>

<p>
We continued our approach, following the two
turkey buzzards, who at length made a stand under the
star-apple tree, where the grass was long and rank, as
if it had grown over a grave, hissing and stretching
out their wings, nearly seven feet from tip to tip, and
apparently determined to give battle, as if they had
now retreated to their prey.  Seeing us determined,
however, they gave a sort of hop, or short flight, and
gently lifted themselves on to a branch of the tree
above, about four feet from the ground, where they
remained observing us, and uttering hoarse, discordant
croaks, sounding as if they had been gorged to the
throat with carrion already, and shaking their heads,
and snorting as if their nostrils had been choked with
rotten flesh; polluting the air at the same time with
a horrible stench, and casting wistful glances down
into the tuft of rank grass beneath.
</p>

<p>
This state of suspense was horrible, so with one
accord we drove the obscene creatures from their perch,
and stepping forward, looked into the rank tuft.
Heaven and earth! what a sight was <i>there</i>&mdash;Stretched on
the ground, embedded in the quill-like guinea-grass
that bristled up all around him, lay poor Jessamy on
his face; his clothes soaked and soiled by the rain of
the two preceding nights, and the vile poaching of the
vultures now congregated in the tree above, which
appeared to have been circling round and round him,
from the filth and dirt, and trodden appearance of the
herbage; but as yet deterred from making an attack.
The majesty of the human form, all dim and mangled
though it was, like a faint, but sacred halo, had
quelled the fierceness of their nature, and the body of
the suicide was still unbroken, even after the lapse of
two days, except by the shattering of the pistol-shot
fired by his own sacrilegious hands.  Had it been the
carcass of an ox, twelve hours could not have run by,
before the naked skeleton would have been bleaching
in the sun and wind.
</p>

<p>
There was a broken halter hanging from the branch
above him.
</p>

<p>
"I cannot look at him," said my uncle, shrinking
back in disgust; and as he spoke, the John Crows
dropped down again, and began to move warily about
the body, but still afraid to attack it.
</p>

<p>
Finding that we were not retreating, however, the
creatures flew up into the tree once more; and our
eyes following them, we saw at least a score clustered
immediately overhead, all ready, no doubt, to devour
the carcass, so soon as those below should give the
signal.
</p>

<p>
It seemed probable that he had tied his horse
to the branch above where he lay, and that the
animal had subsequently, when impelled by hunger,
broken the halter.  He had laid his hat on the sward
close beside him, with his watch and silk handkerchief
in it, and drawn off his gloves, which were
placed, seemingly with some care, on the edge of it.
He had then apparently knelt, shot himself through
the head, and fallen on his face across the pistol.  As
we approached, the buzz of flies that rose up!&mdash;and the
incipient decomposition that appeared on the hands!
We waited to see the body turned&mdash;but the ghastly
and shattered forehead&mdash;the hair clotted in black
gore&mdash;the brains fermenting through the eyes&mdash;the mask
of festering and putrifying and crawling matter that
was left on the ground, with the print of the features
in it&mdash;Horrible&mdash;most horrible!
</p>

<p>
An inquest was held that afternoon, when the poor
fellow was put into a shell in his clothes, and buried
where he lay;&mdash;in consecrated ground, as I have
already related.  Some unfortunate speculations in
business, working on a very sensitive nature, had turned
his brain, and in a godless hour he had made away
with himself.  But two days before I had seen him
full of fun and gaiety, although possibly the
excitement was not natural, and now!&mdash;&mdash;Alas, poor
Jessamy, we had at least the melancholy satisfaction of
shielding your defaced remains from the awe-inspiring
surse pronounced against the Israelites, if they should
fall away after the sinfulness of the Heathen&mdash;"And
thy carcass shall be meat unto the fowls of the air, and
unto the beasts of the earth, and no man shall fray
them awa."
</p>

<p>
But time and tide wait for no man; so we had to
leave the sad scene, and proceed on our journey.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
"I say, uncle," after we had talked ourselves <i>out</i> on
the melancholy affair, "when shall we come into the
road?"
</p>

<p>
"Road&mdash;road?  why, if you go <i>off</i> the road, Benjie,
you will drop some five hundred feet, or so, down that
precipice, that's all."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see&mdash;so this <i>is the</i> road; why, I thought
we were strolling along some short cut of sheep paths
and river courses.  Road, indeed!"
</p>

<p>
We held on, making easy stages of it from one
friend's house to another, until, on the evening of the
fifth day from the time we left Kingston, we were
once more safe and snug under our own roof at Ballywindle.

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
</h3>

<h4>
THE MOONBEAM.
</h4>

<p>
The morning after we arrived, we were sitting at
breakfast, talking over our past expedition, and plans
for the future, when two letters were laid on the table.
The first was to my uncle, and ran as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>Havanna, such a date.</i>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"MY DEAR FRENCHE,
</p>

<p>
"I sailed from this on the 15th ult., and had got
pretty well to the northward, when it came on to blow
like fury, and I was driven back with the loss of
several of my sails, and the bowsprit badly sprung.
</p>

<p>
"Knowing that I would touch here on my way
home, I had desired letters to be forwarded from
England if any thing material occurred, to the care of Mr
M&mdash;&mdash;; and accordingly, on my return, I received one
from our mutual friend Ferrit, of Lincoln's-Inn,
informing me of my brother Henry's death; and what
surprised me, after all that had passed, an acknowledgment
of his having been married, from the first, to that
plaguy Swiss girl, Mademoiselle Heloise de Walden.
This makes a serious difference in my worldly affairs,
you will at once see, as the boy, whom you may
remember as a child, must now be acknowledged as the
head of the family.  But as I have no children of my
own, and have wherewithal to keep the old lady and
myself comfortable, and had already left Henry my
heir, having as good as adopted him, I am rather
rejoiced at it than otherwise, although he does me out
of a baronetcy.  Why that poor dissipated brother of
mine should have been so much ashamed of acknowledging
his low marriage, I am sure I cannot tell; as
the girl, I have heard say, was handsome, and tolerably
educated.  But now, of course, the murder is out, so
there is no use in speculating farther on the matter;
Ferrit writes me, that the documents confirmatory of
the marriage are all right and properly authenticated,
and he sends me a probate of poor Henry's will, to
communicate to his son, who is now Sir Henry
Oakplank, and must instantly drop the De Walden.
</p>

<p>
"I have sent letters for him to the admiral; but as
the youngster may fall in your way in the Spider, to
which I have appointed him, and in which he sailed
for Jamaica a few days before my return here, I think,
for the sake of your old crony, poor Henry, as well as
for mine, that you will be glad to pay the boy some
attention.
</p>

<p>
"Give my regards to Benjie Brail, if still with you.
I have got a noble freight on board&mdash;near a million of
dollars&mdash;so, in the hope of meeting you soon in
England, I remain, my dear Frenche, your sincere friend
and old schoolfellow,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"OLIVER OAKPLANK."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
The next letter was as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>H. M. Schooner Spider, Montego Bay&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  such a date.</i><br />
</p>

<p>
"MY DEAR SIR,&mdash;I have only a minute to advise
you of my arrival here this morning, and of being again
under weigh, in consequence of what I have just
learned of the vagaries of our old acquaintance the Midge.
I trust I may fall in with her.  I saw your friends, the
Hudsons, safe outside the Moro, on the &mdash; ulto., in
the fine new ship, the Ajax.  I left them stemming
the gulf stream with a beautiful breeze.
</p>

<p>
"I wish you would have a letter lying in the hands
of the agents, Peaweep, Snipe, and Flamingo, in
Kingston for me, as I am bound to Port Royal whenever
my present cruise is up.  Yours sincerely,
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"HENRY DE WALDEN."
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Aha, Master de Walden&mdash;not a word about
Mademoiselle Sophie, eh? my <i>friends</i> the Hudsons
indeed! but never mind&mdash;I rejoice in your good
fortune, my lad."
</p>

<p>
That very forenoon I was taken ill with fever and
ague, and became gradually worse, until I was so weak
that I could scarcely stand.
</p>

<p>
Lennox had come up to see me one morning after
I had been a week ill; he informed me that old Jacob
Munroe was dead, having left him a heap of money;
and that he was about going down to the Musquito
Shore in the schooner Moonbeam, a shell trader
belonging to his late uncle, and now to himself, as a
preparatory step to winding up old Jacob's estate, and
leaving the island for Scotland.  Hearing I had been
complaining, a thought had occurred to the
kind-hearted creature, that "a cruise would be just the
thing to set me on my legs again;" and accordingly
he had come to offer me a passage in his schooner.
</p>

<p>
Dr Tozy was standing by.  "Not a bad notion,
Mr Lennox; do you know I had thoughts of
recommending a sea voyage myself, and now since I
know of such a good opportunity, I by all means
recommend Mr Brail to accompany you, unless, indeed,
you are to remain too long in some vile muddy creek
on the Musquito Shore."
</p>

<p>
"No, no, sir, the Jenny Nettles, another vessel of
ours, sailed a fortnight ago, to see that the turtleshell
is all ready, so I won't be eight-and-forty hours
on the coast."
</p>

<p>
"Then it is the very thing."
</p>

<p>
And so it was arranged.  My uncle drove me down
next day to the bay, and the following morning I was
at sea, in the beautiful clipper schooner, the
Moonbeam.  Once more
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "The waters heave around me; and on high<br />
  The winds lift up their voices."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We had been several days out, and were bowling
along nine knots, with a most lovely little breeze
steady on the quarter.  I was lounging at mine ease
under the awning, on a hencoop, reading.  There was
not a cloud in the sky.  The sharp stem was snoring
through the water, the sails were critically well set,
and drawing to a wish, and the dancing blue waves
were buzzing alongside, and gurgling up through the
lee scuppers right cheerily, while the flying fish were
sparkling out in shoals all round us like glass chips,
from one swell to another.  It was one of those
glorious, fresh, and exhilarating mornings in which it is
ecstasy for a young chap to <i>live</i>, and which are to be
found in no other climate under the sun.  Besides, I
was in raptures with the little fairy, for she was a
beauty in every respect, and with the bracing air that
was hour by hour setting me up again.  While I am
thus luxuriating, I will tell you a story&mdash;so come
along, my boy.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="t3">
A NEGRO QUARREL.
</p>

<p>
We had several negroes amongst the Moonbeams,
one of whom, a sail-maker, was occupied close to where
I lay, with his palm and needle, following his vocation,
and mending a sail on deck&mdash;another black diamond,
a sort of half-inch carpenter, was busy with some job
abaft of him.  I had often noticed before, the
peculiar mode in which negroes quarrel.  I would say that
they did so very classically, after the model of Homer's
heroes, for instance, as they generally prelude their
combats with long speeches&mdash;or perhaps it would be
more correct to call their method the Socratic mode
of fighting&mdash;-as they commence and carry on with a
series of questions, growing more and more stinging
as they proceed, until a fight becomes the necessary
consequence, indeed, unavoidable; as in the present case.
</p>

<p>
The origin of the dispute was rather complex.
There was an Indian boy on board, of whom more
anon; and this lad, Lennox, with a spice of his original
calling, had been in the habit of teaching to read,
and to learn a variety of infantile lessons, which he
in turn took delight in retailing to the negroes; and
there he is working away at this moment, reversing
the order of things&mdash;the young teaching the old.
</p>

<p>
Palmneedle appears a very dull scholar, while Chip,
I can perceive, is sharp enough, and takes delight in
piquing Palmy.  Chip says his lesson glibly.  "Ah,
daddy Chip, you shall make one parson by and by&mdash;quite
cleber dis morning&mdash;so now, Palmneedle, come
along;" and Palmy also acquitted himself tolerably for
some time.
</p>

<p>
"What you call hanimal hab four legs?" said Indio,
in continuation of the lesson, and holding up four
fingers.  Here I thought of my cousin Sally.
</p>

<p>
"One cow," promptly rejoined Palmneedle, working
away at the sail he was mending.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;to be sure! certainly one cow hab four legs;
but what is de cow call?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, some time Nancy; some time Juba."
</p>

<p>
"Stupid&mdash;I mean what you call ebery cow."
</p>

<p>
"How de debil should I sabe, Indio?"
</p>

<p>
"Becaase," said Indio, "I tell you dis morning
already, one, tre, five time; but stop, I sall find one
way to make you remember.  How much feets you
hab yourself&mdash;surely you can tell me dat?"
</p>

<p>
"Two&mdash;I hab two feets&mdash;dere."
</p>

<p>
"Den, what is you call?"
</p>

<p>
"One quadruped.  You tink I don't know dat?"
</p>

<p>
"One quadruped! ho, ho&mdash;I know you would say
so&mdash;you say so yesterday&mdash;really you wery mosh
blockhead indeed&mdash;<i>dat</i> is what de cow is call, man.
You!&mdash;why you is call one omnivorous biped widout
fedder&mdash;dat is what you is call; and de reason, Massa
Lennox tell me, is, because you nyam as mosh as ever
you can get, and don't wear no fedder like one
fowl&mdash;mind dat&mdash;you is one omnivorous biped."  Here Chip
began, I saw, to quiz Palmy also.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Massa Indio," said the former, "let me be
coolmassa one leetle piece.  I say, Palmy, it is find
dat you hab two feets&mdash;dat you eats all you can grab,"
(<i>aside</i>), "your own and your neighbours"&mdash;(<i>then
aloud</i>)&mdash;"dat you hab no fedders in your tail&mdash;and derefore
you is call <i>one somniferous tripod</i>" (at least what
he said sounded more like <i>this</i> than any thing else).
"Now, dere is dat ugly old one-foot neger cookey"
(the fellow was black as a sloe himself), "wid his
wooden leg, what would you call <i>he?</i> tink well now;
he only hab <i>one</i> leg, you know."
</p>

<p>
"One <i>unicorn</i>," said Palmy, after a pause, and
scratching his woolly skull.  But my laughter here
put an end to the school, and was the innocent means
of stirring up Palmy's wrath, who, mortified at
perceiving that I considered the others had been quizzing
him, was not long of endeavouring to work out his
revenge.  Slow as he might be at his learning, he was
any thing but slow in this.  Palmneedle now took the
lead in the dialogue.  "Chip," said Palmy, "enough
of nonsense; so tell me how you lef de good old
woman, your moder, eh?"
</p>

<p>
Chip, who was caulking his seam, at this laid down
his caulking-iron and mallet, pulled up his sleeve,
fidgeted with the waistband of his trowsers, turned his
quid, spat in his fist, and again commenced operations,
grumbling out very gruffly, "my moder is dead."  He
had clearly taken offence, as Palmy evidently expected
he would do; but <i>why</i>, I could not divine.  Palmy
proceeded in his lesson of "teazing made easy."
</p>

<p>
"Nice old woman&mdash;sorry to hear dat."  The rascal
had known it, however, all along.  "Ah, now I
remember; she was mosh swell when I last see him&mdash;and
face bloat&mdash;Ah, I feared, for long time, she would
take to nyam dirt at last."
</p>

<p>
"Who tell you so&mdash;who say my moder eat dirt?"
cried Chip, deeply stung; for the greatest affront you
can put on a negro, is to cast in his teeth either that
he himself, or some of his near of kin, labour under
that mysterious complaint, <i>mal d'estomac</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, nobody," rejoined Palmy, with a careless toss
of the head; "I only tought she look wery like it&mdash;glad
to hear it was not so, howsomedever&mdash;but sartain
she look wery mosh like it&mdash;you mos allow dat
yourself, Chip?"  The carpenter made no answer, but I
could see it was working.  Palmy now began to sing
in great glee, casting a wicked glance every now and
then at his crony, who thundered away, rap, rap, rap,
and thump, thump, thump, on the deck, paying the
seam, as he shuffled along, with tobacco juice most
copiously.  At length he got up, and passed forward.
Palmy sang louder and louder.
</p>

<p>
"Come, mind you don't change your tune before
long, my boy," said I to myself.
</p>

<p>
Chip now returned, carrying a pot of molten pitch
in his hand.  As he stepped over Palmy's leg, he spilt,
by accident of course, some of the hot fluid on his foot.
</p>

<p>
"Broder Palmneedle&mdash;broder Palmneedle&mdash;I am
wery sorry; but it was one haxident, you know."
</p>

<p>
Palmy winced a little, but said nothing; and the
master of the schooner coming on deck, sent Chip to
stretch the sail in some particular way, and to hold it
there, for the convenience of the sailmaker.  Every
thing remained quiet between them as long as the
skipper was near, and I continued my reading; but
very shortly, I heard symptoms of the scald operating
on our sailmaker's temper, as the affront had done on
the carpenter's.
</p>

<p>
Quoth Chip to Palmneedle, as he sat down on deck,
and took hold of the sail, "Really hope I haven't
burnt you, ater all, Palmneedle?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no, not at all," drawing in his scalded toe,
however, as if he had got the gout in it.
</p>

<p>
"Quite glad of dat; but him do look swell a leetle,
and de kin begin to peel off a bit, I am sorry to see."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, no," quoth Palmy again,&mdash;"quite cool, no
pain, none at all."
</p>

<p>
A pause&mdash;Palmy tries to continue his song, but in
vain, and presently gives a loud screech as Chip, in
turning over the clew of the sail roughly, brought the
earring down crack on the parboiled toe.  "What you
mean by dat?"
</p>

<p>
"What! have I hurt you?  Ah, poor fellow, I see
I <i>have burnt</i> you now, ater all."
</p>

<p>
"I tell you I is not <i>burn</i>," sings out Palmy, holding
his toe hard with one hand; "but don't you see you
have nearly <i>broken</i> my foot?  Why did you hit me,
sir, wid de clew of dat heavy sail, sir, as if it had been
one mallet?  Did you do it o' propos?"
</p>

<p>
"Do it on purpose?" rejoins Chip.  "My eye!  I
drop it light, light&mdash;just so;" and here he thundered
the iron earring down on the deck once more, missing
the toe for the second time by a hairbreadth, and only
through Palmy's activity in withdrawing it.
</p>

<p>
At this Palmy's pent-up wrath fairly exploded, and
he smote Chip incontinently over the pate with his
iron marlinspike, who returned with his wooden
mallet, and the action then began in earnest&mdash;the
combatants rolling over and over on the deck, kicking and
spurring, and biting, and bucking each other with their
heads like maniacs, or two monkeys in the hydrophobia,
until the row attracted the attention of the rest
of the crew, and they were separated.
</p>

<p class="thought">
*****
<br />
</p>

<p>
I had risen early the next morning, and was
wearying most particularly for the breakfast hour, when
Quacco, who was, as usual, head cook and captain's
steward, came to me.  "Massa, you never see soch
an a face as Mr Lennox hab dis morning."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what is wrong with him, Quacco?"
</p>

<p>
"I tink he mos hab sleep in de moon, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Sleep in the moon!  A rum sort of a lodging,
Quacco.  What do you mean?"
</p>

<p>
"I mean he mos hab been sleep in de moonlight
on deck, widout no cover at all, massa."  And so we
found he had, sure enough, and the consequence was,
a swelled face, very much like the moon herself in a
fog, by the way, as if she had left her impress on the
poor fellow's mug; "her moonstruck child;" but I
have no time for poetry.  It looked more like
erysipelas than any thing else, and two days elapsed before
the swelling subsided; during the whole of which
the poor fellow appeared to me&mdash;but it might have
been fancy&mdash;more excited and out of the way than I
had seen him since the prison scene at Havanna.
</p>

<p>
Can it be possible that the planet really does exercise
such influences as we read of, thought I?  At any
rate, I now for the first time knew the literal
correctness of the beautiful Psalm&mdash;"The sun shall not
smite thee by day, <i>nor the moon by night</i>."
</p>

<p>
We were now a week at sea; the morning had been
extremely squally, but towards noon the breeze
became steadier, and we again made more sail, after
which Lennox, the master of the schooner, and I,
went to dinner.  This skipper, by the way, was a
rather remarkable personage,&mdash;<i>first</i>, he rejoiced in the
euphoneous, but somewhat out of the way, appellation
of Tobias Tooraloo; <i>secondly</i>, his face was not a tragic
volume, but a leaf out of a farce.  It was for all the
world like the monkey face of a cocoa-nut; there
being only three holes perceptible to the naked eye in
it; that is, <i>one</i> mouth, always rounded and pursed up
as if he had been whistling, and <i>two</i> eyes, such as they
were, both squinting inwards so abominably, that one
guessed they were looking for his nose.  Now, if a
person had been set to make an inventory of his
physiognomy, at first sight, against this last mentioned feature,
the return would certainly have been <i>non est inventus</i>.
But the curious dial <i>had</i> a gnomon, such as it was,
countersunk, it is true, in the phiz, and the wings so
nicely bevelled away into the cheeks, that it could not
well be vouched for either, unless when he sneezed;
which, like the blowing of a whale, proved the reality
of apertures, although you might not see them.  His
figure was short and squat; his arms peculiarly
laconic; and as he always kept them in motion, like a pair
of flappers, his presence might be likened to that of a
turtle on its hind fins.
</p>

<p>
The manner and speech of El Señor Tobias were,
if possible, more odd than his outward and physical
man; his delivery being a curious mixture of what
appeared to be a barbarous recitative, or sing-song, and
suppressed laughter; although the latter was only a
nervous frittering away of the fag end of his
sentences, and by no means intended to express mirth; the
voice sounding as if he were choke-full of new bread,
or the words had been sparked off from an ill set
barrel organ, revolving in his brisket.
</p>

<p>
"I hope," said I, to this beauty, "you may not be
out in your reckoning about your cargo of shell being
ready for you on the coast, captain?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, oh no,&mdash;ho, ho, ho," chuckled Tooraloo.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce are you laughing at?" said I, a
good deal surprised.  Being a silent sort of fellow his
peculiarity had not been so noticeable before.
</p>

<p>
"Laugh&mdash;laugh&mdash;ho, ho, he.  I am not laughing,
sir&mdash;quite serious&mdash;he, he, ho."
</p>

<p>
"It is a way Mr Tooraloo has got," said Lennox,
smiling.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see it is."
</p>

<p>
"I am sure there will be no disappointment this
time, sir,&mdash;<i>now</i>, since Big Claw is out of the
way,&mdash;ho, ho, ho,"&mdash;quoth Toby.
</p>

<p>
"Big Claw&mdash;who is Big Claw?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"An Indian <i>chief</i>, sir, and one of our <i>chief</i> traders,&mdash;he,
he, ho,&mdash;and best customer, sir,&mdash;ho, ho, he,&mdash;but
turned rogue at last, sir, rogue at last&mdash;he, he,
he&mdash;left my mate with him, and Tom the Indian boy,
voyage before last&mdash;he, he, he&mdash;and when I came
back, he had cheated them both.  Oh dear, if we did
not lose fifty weight of shell,&mdash;ho, ho, he."
</p>

<p>
"And was that all?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"<i>That was all</i>&mdash;ho, ho, he," replied Toby.
</p>

<p>
"Your mate was ill used, you said, by Big Claw?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes,&mdash;ho, ho, he."
</p>

<p>
"As how, may I ask?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Big Claw <i>cut</i> his throat, <i>that's all</i>&mdash;ho, ho, ho."
</p>

<p>
"<i>All</i>? rather uncivil, however," said I.
</p>

<p>
"<i>Very</i>, sir,"&mdash;quoth Toby,&mdash;"he, he, he."
</p>

<p>
"And why did he cut his throat?"
</p>

<p>
"Because he made free with one of Big Claw's
wives&mdash;ho, ho."
</p>

<p>
"So&mdash;that was not the thing, certainly; and what
became of the wife?"
</p>

<p>
"Cut <i>her</i> throat, too&mdash;ha, ha, ha!"&mdash;as if this had
been the funniest part of the whole story.
</p>

<p>
"The devil he did!" said I.  "What a broth of a
boy this same Big Claw must be; and Indian Tom,
I see him on board here?"
</p>

<p>
"Cut <i>his</i> throat too though&mdash;ho ho, ho&mdash;but <i>he</i>
recovered."
</p>

<p>
"Why, I supposed as much, since he is waiting
behind your chair there, captain.  And what became of
this infernal Indian bravo&mdash;this Master Big Claw, as
you call him?"
</p>

<p>
"Cut his <i>own</i> throat&mdash;ha, ha, ha!&mdash;cut his own
throat, the very day we arrived, by Gom, ha, ha,
ha! ooro! looro! hooro;" for this being a sort of climax,
he treated us with an extra rumblification in his
gizzard, at the end of it.
</p>

<p>
Here we all joined in honest Tooraloo's ha, ha,
ha!&mdash;for the absurdity of the way in which the
story was screwed out of him, no mortal could stand&mdash;a
story that, on the face of it at first, bore simply to
have <i>eventuated</i> in the paltry loss of fifty pounds'
weight of turtle-shell; but which in reality involved
the destruction of no fewer than three fellow creatures,
and the grievous maiming of a fourth.  "<i>That's all</i>,
indeed!"
</p>

<p>
By this time it might have been half-past two, and
the tears were still wet on my cheeks, when the
vessel was suddenly laid over by a heavy puff, so that
before the canvass could be taken in, or the schooner
luffed up and the wind shaken out of her sails, we
carried away our foretopmast, topsail and all; and, what
was a more serious matter, sprung the head of the
mainmast so badly, that we could not carry more than
a close-reefed mainsail on it.  What was to be done?
It was next to impossible to secure the mast properly
at sea; and as the wind had veered round to the
south-east, we could not fetch the creek on the Indian
coast, whither we were bound, unless we had all our
after-sail.  There was nothing for it, therefore, but to
bear up for San Andreas, now dead under our lee;
where we might get the mast comfortably fished.  We
accordingly did so, and anchored there about dusk, on
the seventh evening after leaving Montego bay.
</p>

<p>
San Andreas, although in reality belonging to the
crown of Spain, was at the time, so far as I could
learn, in the sole possession, if I may so speak, of a
Scotchman, a Mr ***;&mdash;at least there were no
inhabitants on the island that we heard any thing about,
beyond himself, family, and negroes, with the latter of
whom he cultivated any cotton that was grown on it;
sending it from time to time to the Kingston market.
</p>

<p>
We had come to, near his house; and when the vessel
was riding safe at anchor, the captain and I went
ashore in the boat to call on Mr ***, in order to make
known our wants, and endeavour to get them remedied.
There was not a soul on the solitary beach where we
landed, but we saw lights in a long low building that
was situated on a ridge on the right hand of the bay,
as you stood in; and in one or two of the negro huts
surrounding it, and clustered below nearer the beach.
After some search, we got into a narrow gravelly path,
worn in the rocky hill side, like a small river course
or gully, with crumbling edges of turf, about a foot
high on each hand, against which we battered our
knees at every step, as we proceeded.
</p>

<p>
It was a clear starlight night, and the dark house on
the summit of the ridge stood out in bold relief against
the deep blue sky.  "Hush&mdash;hark!"  A piano was
struck with some skill, and a female voice began the
beautiful song set to the tune of the old Scottish
melody "The Weary Fund o' Tow."
</p>

<p>
This was a startling incident, to occur thus at the
world's end.
</p>

<p>
"Hey day!" said I; but before I could make any
farther remark, a full rich male voice struck in at the
chorus&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "He's far away, he's far away, but surely he will come;<br />
  Ye moments fly, pass swiftly by, and send my soldier home."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
We remained riveted to the spot until the music ceased.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Tooraloo, Toby, my lad; you have not
sculled us to fairy land, have you?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh no, it is old Mr ***'s daughter, the only
white lady in the island that I know of; and I
suppose one of her brothers is accompanying her&mdash;ho, ho, he."
</p>

<p>
"Very like; but who have we here?" as a tall dark
figure in jacket and trowsers, with a Spanish cap on
his head, came dancing along the ridge from the house,
and singing to himself, apparently in the exuberance
of his spirits.
</p>

<p>
He was soon close to, confronting us in the narrow
road, bounding from side to side of the crumbling
ledges of the footpath with the buoyancy of boyhood,
although the frame, seen between me and the starlight
sky, appeared Herculean.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo, Walpole, what has kept you so late?"
</p>

<p>
We made no answer, and the figure closed upon us.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, is Mr *** at home&mdash;he, he, he?" said our
skipper to the stranger.
</p>

<p>
The party addressed stopped suddenly, and appeared
a good deal startled.  But he soon recovered
himself, and answered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"He is.  May I ask who makes the enquiry in such
a merry mood?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes; I am the master of the Moonbeam&mdash;ha, ha,
ha&mdash;a Montego bay trader, bound to the Indian coast,
but obliged to put in here in distress&mdash;he, he,
ho&mdash;having badly sprung some of our spars&mdash;ha, ha, ha."
</p>

<p>
"Then what the h&mdash;l are you laughing at, sir?"
rejoined the stranger, savagely.
</p>

<p>
"Laugh&mdash;laugh&mdash;why, I am quite serious, sir&mdash;sad
as a drowned rat&mdash;why, I am put in here <i>in distress</i>,
sir&mdash;ha, ha, ha."
</p>

<p>
It was time for me to strike in, I saw.  "It is a
peculiarity in the gentleman's manner, sir, and no
offence is meant."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, very well," said the other, laughing himself,
and turning to Toby once more.  "And this other?"
continued he, very unceremoniously indicating
myself, to be sure.
</p>

<p>
"My passenger&mdash;he, he, he!"&mdash;said the man, with
some discretion, as there was no use in our case of
mentioning names, or being more communicative than
necessary.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see&mdash;good-night&mdash;good-night."  And away
sprang my gentleman, without saying another word.
</p>

<p>
"He might have waited until we got time to ask
him who <i>he was</i>, at any rate," said I.
</p>

<p>
"Why," said Toby, "that may be a question he
may have no joy in answering&mdash;-ha, ha, ha!"
</p>

<p>
"True for <i>you</i>, Tooraloo," said I Benjie.
</p>

<p>
We arrived in front of the low building, whose
windows opened on a small terrace or esplanade, like
so many port-holes.
</p>

<p>
It stood on a ridge of limestone-rock, <i>a saddle</i>, as
it is called in the West Indies, or tongue of land, that
from fifty or sixty feet high, where the house stood,
dropped gradually, until it ended in a low, sandy spit,
covered with a clump of cocoa-nut trees, with tufts of
mangrove bushes here and there; forming the cape
or foreland of the bay on the right hand as you stood
in.  This low point trended outwards like a hook, so
as to shut in the entrance of a small concealed cove
or natural creek, which lay beyond it, separated from
the bay we lay in by the aforesaid tongue of land,
so that the house commanded a view of both anchorages.
</p>

<p>
From one side, as already related, the acclivity was
easy; but towards the creek the ground fell away
sudden and precipitously; and on the very edge of
this rugged bank the house was perched, like an
eagle's nest, overhanging the little land-locked cave.
</p>

<p>
There was a group of fishermen negroes in front of
the house, talking and gabbling loudly as usual, one
of whom carried a net, while three others followed
him with broad-bladed paddles on their shoulders, as
if they had been pursuing their calling, and were now
retiring to their houses for the night.
</p>

<p>
"Is Mr *** at home?" said Tooraloo&mdash;really I
can no longer be bothered jotting down his absurd
ho, ho, he.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, massa," said the negro addressed; and
without waiting to knock, or give any sign of our
approach, the skipper and I entered the hall, or centre
room of the building.
</p>

<p>
By the partial light proceeding from the open door
of an inner apartment, I could see that it was a
desolate-looking place, with a parcel of bags of cotton
piled up in a corner, and lumbered, rather than
furnished, with several skranky leathern-backed Spanish
chairs.
</p>

<p>
Several rooms opened off each end of the said hall,
beside the one from which the light streamed.  The
skipper unceremoniously passed on to this apartment,
motioning to me to follow him.  I did so, and found
an old gentleman, dressed in a gingham coat and
white trowsers, and wearing a well-worn tow wig and
spectacles, seated at a small table, smoking, with a
glass of spirits and water beside him, and an empty
tumbler opposite, as if some one had been accompanying
him in his potations; while a young lady, rather
a pretty girl, seated at a piano, with some music open
before her, was screening her eyes from the light,
and employed, so far as I could judge, in peering
down towards the cove, as if trying to make out some
object in that direction.
</p>

<p>
"Well, father, I cannot see either of them; surely
they have put out all the lights on purpose&mdash;not a
glimmer, I declare."  Turning round, she started on
seeing us, and rising, left the room suddenly by
another door.
</p>

<p>
"Who may <i>ye</i> be now?" quoth the old man, rather
testily, as if some recent visitors had not been
over and above acceptable, taking his cigar at the
same time out of his mouth, and knocking the ashes
off the end of it against the candlestick.  "Are you
any of Captain Wallace's people?"
</p>

<p>
"No," said Tooraloo.  "Was that Captain Wallace
we met going down the path just now?"
</p>

<p>
He gave no answer, but again enquired, in a still
more sharp and querulous tone, "<i>who we</i> were?
Wha the deevil are ye, I say?  Wull ye no speak?"
</p>

<p>
"Toby," said I, "out with your ditty, man."  So
our situation was speedily explained to him&mdash;that we
had bore up in distress, and wanted assistance.  The
issue was, after a good deal of palaver, that he
promised to send his people to lend a hand with our
repairs in the morning.
</p>

<p>
"But <i>who was</i> the gentleman we met?" said I,
repeating Toby's question, and endeavouring to pin
the crusty old gentleman to an answer.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed, sir," said he, now greatly relieved, as he
began to understand our real character, and the
peacefulness of our object&mdash;"indeed, sir, I cannot rightly
tell.  He is an American, I rather think, and
commands two Buenos-Ayrean"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here some one coughed significantly under the
open window.  The old man looked dogged and
angry at this, as if he had said, "What the
deuce! mayn't I say what I choose in my own house?"  And
gulping down his grog with great fierceness, as
if determined not to understand the hint, he
continued, speaking emphatically through his set teeth&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir, he commands two privateers at anchor
down in the cove there."
</p>

<p>
The signal was now twice repeated.  It was clear
there were eaves-droppers abroad.  Our host lay back
sullenly in his chair.
</p>

<p>
"Ay! and what kind of craft may they be?"
</p>

<p>
I scarcely knew what I said, as the notion of the
privateers, and of having gentry of the usual stamp
of their crews in such near neighbourhood, was any
thing but pleasant or comfortable.
</p>

<p>
"A schooner and a felucca, sir," said Mr *** in
answer.
</p>

<p>
Some one now thundered against the weather-boarding
of the house, making every thing shake
again, as if a drunken man had fallen against a
hollow bulk-head, and I heard a low, grumbling voice,
as if in suppressed anger.  I could see with half an
eye that <i>this</i> had aroused the old gentleman to a
sense of his danger, and made him pocket his peevishness;
for he now <i>set</i> himself in his chair, screwing
his withered features into a most taciturn expression.
</p>

<p>
"The Midge again," thought I, "by all that is
unfortunate!  Oh for a glimpse of Henry de
Walden and his Spider!"
</p>

<p>
It is the devil and all to be watched&mdash;to have the
consciousness that the very stones are listening to
you, and ready to fly at your head, and no armour,
offensive or defensive, about you.
</p>

<p>
A sort of desperation was in consequence coming
over me; and I rapped out, but still speaking so low,
that I considered it impossible I could be overheard
by any one without&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"I think I know that same Captain Wallace's
voice&mdash;I have heard it before, I am persuaded."
</p>

<p>
"You have, have you?" said some one outside,
with great bitterness, but also in a suppressed tone.
</p>

<p>
The exclamation was apparently involuntary.  I
started, and looked round, but saw no one.
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of him, as I said before, gentlemen,"
continued our host.
</p>

<p>
At this moment I had turned my face from the
open window towards Toby, to see how he took all
this.  A small glass hung on the wall above his head,
in which (murder, I grew as cold as an ice-cream!)
I had a momentary glimpse of a fierce, sun-burned
countenance, the lips apart, and the white teeth set
as if in anger, raised just above the window sill.  It
glanced for an instant in the yellow light, while a
clenched hand was held above it, and shaken
threateningly at old ***.
</p>

<p>
I turned suddenly round, but the apparition had as
suddenly disappeared.  It was clear that *** now
wished more than ever to end the conference.
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing beyond what I have told you,
gentlemen&mdash;<i>he</i> pays for every thing like a prince&mdash;for
his wood, and provisions, and all, down to a nail."
</p>

<p>
I was <i>now</i> noways anxious to prolong the conversation
myself.
</p>

<p>
"I don't doubt it, I don't doubt it.  Well, old
gentleman, good-night.  You will send your people
early?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh yes, you may be sure of that."
</p>

<p>
And we left the house and proceeded to the beach,
as fast, you may be sure, as we decently could,
without <i>running</i>.  We both noticed a dark figure bustle
round the corner of the house, as we stepped out on
the small plateau on which it stood.
</p>

<p>
Captain Toby hailed the schooner, in no very
steady tone, to send the boat ashore
instantly&mdash;"<i>instantly</i>"&mdash;and I sat down on a smooth, blue, and
apparently wave-rounded stone, that lay imbedded in
the beautiful white sand.
</p>

<p>
"So, so, a leaf out of a romance&mdash;miracles will
never cease," said I to Tooraloo, who was standing a
short distance from me, close to the water's edge,
looking out anxiously for the boat.  "There is the
old Midge again, Toby, and my Montego bay friend,
Wilson, for a dozen&mdash;mind he don't treat us to a
second
</p>

<p class="poem">
  Edition of the Ballahoo,<br />
  Dear Toby Tooraloo.<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Why, captain, there is no speaking to you, except in
rhyme, that name of yours is so&mdash;&mdash;Hillo! where
away&mdash;an earthquake? or are the stones alive here?
So ho, Tobias&mdash;see where I am travelling to, Toby,"
as the rock on which I sat began to heave beneath
me, and to make a strange clappering sort of noise, as
if one had been flapping the sand with wet swabs.
</p>

<p>
"Tooraloo, see here&mdash;see here&mdash;I am bewitched,
and going to sea on a shingle stone, as I am a
gentleman&mdash;I hope it can <i>swim</i> as well as <i>walk</i>"&mdash;and
over I floundered on my back.
</p>

<p>
I had come ashore without my jacket, and, as the
skipper picked me up, I felt something warm and
slimy flowing down my back.
</p>

<p>
"Why, where is my cruizer, Toby,&mdash;and what
the deuce can that be so warm and wet between my
shoulders?"
</p>

<p>
"A turtle nest&mdash;a turtle nest," roared Toby, in
great joy,&mdash;and so indeed it proved.
</p>

<p>
Accordingly, we collected about two dozen of the
eggs, and, if I had only had my senses about me
when I capsized, we might have turned over the
lady-fish herself, whom I had so unkindly disturbed
in the straw, when she moved below me.  We got
on board without more ado, and having desired the
steward to get a light and some food and grog in the
cabin, I sent for Lennox, who was busy with the
repairs going on aloft, and, as I broke ground very
seriously to make my supper, communicated to him
what we had seen and heard.
</p>

<p>
I had already in the course of the voyage acquainted
him with the particulars of the ball at Mr Roseapple's,
and of my meeting with, and suspicions of
Mr Wilson, and that I verily believed I had fallen in
with the same person this very night, in the captain
of a Buenos-Ayrean privateer.
</p>

<p>
"A privateer!" ejaculated Lennox,&mdash;"a privateer!&mdash;is
there a privateer about the island?'
</p>

<p>
"<i>A</i> privateer!" said the captain of the Moonbeam&mdash;"no&mdash;not
<i>one</i>, but <i>two</i> of them, ha, ha, he&mdash;and
both anchored t'other side of the bluff there, he, he,
ho&mdash;within pistol-shot of us where we now lie, as
the crow flies; although they might remain for a
year in that cove, and no one the wiser, ho, ho,
he.&mdash;In my humble opinion, they will be foul of us before
morning, ho, ho, he&mdash;and most likely cut all our
throats, ha, ha, ho."
</p>

<p>
Poor Saunders Skelp on this fell into a great quandary.
</p>

<p>
"What <i>shall</i> we do, Mr Brail?&mdash;we shall be plundered,
as sure as fate."
</p>

<p>
"I make small doubt of that," quoth I, "and I
only hope <i>that</i> may be the worst of it; but if you and
the skipper think with me, I would be off this very
hour, sprung mast and all."
</p>

<p>
"How unfortunate!" said Lennox&mdash;"Why, I
have been working by candle-light ever since you
went away, stripping the mast, and seeing all clear
when the day broke to&mdash;&mdash;But come, I think a
couple of hours may still replace every thing where it
was before I began."
</p>

<p>
Our determination was now promptly taken, so
we swigged off our horns, and repaired on deck.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there?" said some one from forward, in
evident alarm.
</p>

<p>
It was pitch dark, and nothing could be seen but
the dim twinkle of the lantern, and the heads and
arms of the men at work at the mast head.
</p>

<p>
"Who is there, aft by the companion?"
</p>

<p>
"Why, it is me, what do you want?" said Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing particular, sir, only there are people on
the water close to, ahead of us&mdash;take care they do
not make free with the buoy."
</p>

<p>
"Hail them then, Williams, and tell them, if they
don't keep off, that we will fire at them."
</p>

<p>
"I have hailed them twice, sir, but they give no
answer."
</p>

<p>
We all went forward.  For some time I could neither
see nor hear any thing.  At length I thought I
heard low voices, and the dip of an oar now and then.
Presently I distinctly saw white sparkles in the dark
calm water, towards the mouth of the bay, as of a
boat keeping her station on guard.  By and by, we
heard indications of life on the larboard bow also.
</p>

<p>
"Why, we are beset, Lennox, my boy, as sure as
fate," said I.
</p>

<p>
"What boats are those?"
</p>

<p>
No answer.
</p>

<p>
"If you don't speak I will fire at you."
</p>

<p>
A low suppressed laugh followed this threat, and
we heard, as plain as if we had been alongside of the
strangers, three or four sharp clicks, like the cocking
of strong musket locks.
</p>

<p>
"Privateers-men, as sure as a gun," said Tooraloo&mdash;"oh
dear, and they are going to fire at us, don't you
hear?"&mdash;and he ducked his pate, as if he had seen
them taking aim.
</p>

<p>
"I see two boats now as plain as can be," said Lennox.
</p>

<p>
"Well, well, if you do, we can't help it," said
I&mdash;"but do take my advice and stand by to be off the
moment there is a breath of wind from the land, <i>will ye</i>?"
</p>

<p>
All hands were called.  We piped belay with the
repairs, secured the mast as well as we could, hoisted
the mainsail, and made every thing ready for a start;
and just as we had hove short, a nice light air came
off the land, as if on purpose; but when in the very
act of tripping the anchor, lo! it fell calm again.  As
to our attempting to tow the schooner out of the bay
with such customers right ahead of us, it would have
been stark staring madness.  We had therefore to let
go again, and began to re-occupy ourselves in peering
into the night.  The roar of the surf on the coast,
now came louder, as it struck me, and hoarser, as if
the ground-swell had begun to roll in more heavily.
</p>

<p>
"We shall have the sea-breeze shortly, Lennox,
take my word for it&mdash;it is blowing a merry capful of
wind close to us out there," said I; but the <i>terral</i>
again sprung up, notwithstanding my prognostication,
so we hove up the anchor, ran up the jib, and
the Moonbeam, after canting with her head to the
eastward, began gradually to slide towards the offing
through the midnight sea.  Presently sparkling
bubbles rippled against the stem, and mixed with
white foam, buzzed past the bows, as she gathered way.
</p>

<p>
Accustomed now to the darkness, we could perceive
the boats ahead separate, and take their stations
one on each bow, keeping way with us, as if
watching us.  We had loaded the two carronades with
musket-balls, and had our twelve muskets on deck.
We continued gliding along, and presently the boats,
as if by signal, lay on their oars, letting us shoot past
them, then closed astern of us, pulling a stroke or
two, as if they had an intention of coming up, on either
side of us.
</p>

<p>
"If you come nearer," said Lennox through the
trumpet to the boat that was pulling on the
starboard side, "so help me God, I will fire at you."
</p>

<p>
No answer.  The breeze at the instant took off,
and they approached within pistol shot, one on each
quarter, where they hung without coming any nearer.
</p>

<p>
"They are only seeing us off, they don't mean to
annoy us, Lennox, after all; so hold on steadily, and
don't mind them," said I.
</p>

<p>
But the zeal of Toby Tooraloo, who had by this
time got much excited, and be hanged to him, had
nearly got us all into a scrape.
</p>

<p>
"You villains, <i>I</i> will teach you," quoth the valiant
Tobias, "to insult an armed vessel&mdash;so stand by
there, men&mdash;give them two of the carronades"&mdash;as if
there had been a whole broadside beside.  And before
Lennox could interfere, he had sung out "Fire!"
</p>

<p>
Bang went both carronades, whisking up the
surface of the sea on either beam into a sparkling
foam, the bullets spanking away in flakes of fire,
until they dropped ashore in the distance.  The same
low fiendish laugh was again heard from the boat
nearest us; and as if they had only waited for this
very foolish act of aggression on our part, to
commence an attack, one of the boats pulled ahead, and
then made right for our starboard bow.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo!" said I, thinking the Rubicon was passed,
and that our only chance now, after Tooraloo's absurd
demonstration, was to put our best foot foremost&mdash;"Sheer
off, whoever you are, or I will show you, my
fine fellow, that we are not <i>playing</i> with you, any
how"&mdash;and picking up a musket, I gave them a
moderate time to see if my threat would have any effect.
Finding it had not, I took deliberate aim at the boat,
and fired.
</p>

<p>
A loud "Ah!" declared that the shot had told.
This was followed by a deep groan, and some one
exclaimed, in Spanish,&mdash;"Oh dios, soy muerto!"
</p>

<p>
"Close and board him," shouted a loud and angry
voice, high above several others, from the same
boat&mdash;"Close and board him&mdash;cut their throats, if they
resist."
</p>

<p>
At this moment, as old Nick would have it, it fell
entirely calm, and the boat began to approach
rapidly; the other threatening our larboard quarter, so
I thought our fate was sealed; but whether they were
not quite satisfied of the kind of reception we might
give them, they once more lay on their oars when
close aboard of us.  A clear and well-blown bugle
from the boat where the man hud been hit, now awoke
the sleeping echoes of the bay.  Gradually they died
away faint and more faint amongst the hills.  All was
still as the grave for a minute.  "Ha, that is no
reverberation, that is no echo; hark, it is answered by
another bugle from the cove.  Now we are in a
remarkably beautiful mess," said I; "see&mdash;see."  A
rocket was here sent up by the other boat, and
instantly answered by a steady red light from beyond
the clump of cocoa-nut trees, through whose hair-like
stems we could perceive the little Midge, with her tall
lateen sail, stealing along in the crimson glare like
some monstrous centipede of the ocean, and propelled
by her sweeps, that flashed up the dark water all round
her into blood-like foam, as if Old Nick's state barge
had floated up red hot and hissing.  A loud rushing
noise at the same instant growled down on us from
seaward, and one could perceive a squall, without
being a pig, whitening the tops of the swell, even
dark as it was.
</p>

<p>
"Haul off," sung out the same voice, just as the
breeze struck us,&mdash;"Sheer off, and let the scoundrel
alone, and mind yourselves&mdash;he will be on the reef
close to us here bodily in a moment."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you for the hint," thought I; "the reef is
close to you, is it?"  Tooraloo had caught at this
also, so it was about ship on the other tack; but we
soon found it was utterly impossible to work out of
the bay in the darkness, with such a breeze as was
now springing up, ignorant as we were besides of the
localities; so it was up helm, for in order to escape
the immediate danger of going ashore on the rocks,
we had no earthly alternative, but the fearful one of
running directly back into the lion's mouth again, and
after having pretty well chafed him too;&mdash;indeed, we
had the utmost difficulty in getting back to our
anchorage before it came on to blow right in like thunder;
and there we lay on deck through the livelong night
exposed to a pitiless shower of rain, in a state of most
unenviable anxiety, expecting every moment to be
boarded and murdered.
</p>

<p>
Neither the felucca nor boats followed us in,
however, so we concluded they had returned to the cove,
as all continued quiet.  But the weariest <i>night</i> must
have an end, as well as the weariest <i>day</i>, and at length
the long looked-for morning broke upon us.

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
</h3>

<h4>
THE BREAKING WAVE.
</h4>

<p>
As the day lightened, the wind fell, and by sunrise,
it was nearly calm in the small bay, although we could
see the breeze roughening the blue waters out at sea.
</p>

<p>
Presently, Mr ***'s negroes came on board; but
before determining what to do, or proceeding with our
repairs, we endeavoured to get out of them some more
information regarding the privateers, to give them no
worse a name, and their crews; apparently, however,
they knew nothing beyond what we were already
acquainted with.
</p>

<p>
"Nice peoples dem&mdash;Captain Wallace!  Oh, quite
one gentleman&mdash;plenty money&mdash;plenty grog&mdash;Ah,
wery nice peoples," was all that Quashie knew or
seemed to care about&mdash;at least all that he would say.
</p>

<p>
While we were yet irresolute as to the prudence of
stripping the mast, with such gentry almost within
earshot, a small dory, or light canoe, shoved her black
snout round the headland on which the cocoa-nuts
grew, paddled by a solitary figure in the stern, with
an animal of some kind or another stuck up,
monkey-fashion, in the bow, which, as it came nearer, I
perceived to be a most noble Spanish bloodhound.  I
looked earnestly at the stranger through the glass,
and concluded at once that he could be no other than
our friend of the preceding evening.
</p>

<p>
"I say, Lennox"&mdash;he had been standing at my
elbow the minute before&mdash;"that's <i>my</i> man&mdash;there"&mdash;pointing
with the telescope.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Lennox is below, sir," said Tooraloo, "but
you are right; it is <i>him</i>, sure enough."
</p>

<p>
The man paddled briskly alongside, when the
bloodhound caught a rope in his teeth, that was
hanging over, and, setting his feet against the bowpost,
held on until his master jumped on board, which he
did with the most perfect <i>sang-froid</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Now for it," thought I; "he is come to tell us
<i>civilly</i> that we are to have our throats cut for shooting
one of his beauties last night."
</p>

<p>
Having deliberately secured his dory, by making
fast the painter round one of the stancheons of the
awning, he called to his dog&mdash;"Matamoro&mdash;here,
boy, here," and saw him safe on board before he had
the civility to make his bow.  At length he turned
to me, and I had <i>now</i> no difficulty whatever in making
out my <i>amigo</i> Mr Wilson, in the identical Buenos
Ayrean captain, although he had altered his appearance
very materially from the time I had seen him in
Jamaica.  Awkward as our position appeared to be
fast getting, I could scarcely keep my eyes off the
beautiful animal that accompanied him; first, because
I admired him exceedingly; and secondly, because
he seemed deucedly inclined to bite me.  He was as
tall as a stag-hound, whose symmetry of head and
figure he conjoined with the strength of the English
bull-dog.  His colour was a pale fawn, gradually
darkening down the legs and along the neck, until the
feet and muzzle were coal black.  He gamboled about
his master like a puppy; but the moment any of us
spoke to him, he raised his back into an angry
curve, with the black streak that ran down it
bristling up like a wild-boar's, and set his long tail
straight, as if it had been a crow-bar, or the
Northumbrian lion's; and then his teeth&mdash;my wig! the
laughing hyæna was a joke to him.  But I must
return from the dog to the man.  He was dressed in
very wide trowsers, of a sort of broad, yellow stripped
silk and cotton Indian stuff; slippers of velvet-looking,
yellowish-brown Spanish leather, and no stockings;
he wore a broad belt of the same sort of leather
round his waist, over the ample folds of an Indian
shawl of a bright yellow colour, with crimson
fringes, the ends of which hung down on one side like a
sash; this was fastened by a magnificent gold buckle
in front, worked into the shape of a thistle.  Through
this cincture was stuck, on the left side, a long,
crooked, ivory-handled knife, in a shark-skin sheath, richly
ornamented with gold; while a beautifully worked
grass purse hung from the other, containing his
cigars, flint, and steel.  His shirt was of dark
ruby-coloured cotton, worked with a great quantity of bright
red embroidery at the sleeves and throat, where it was
fastened with the largest ruby stone I had ever seen;
also fashioned like the head of the aforesaid Scottish
thistle, with emerald leaves, and set in a broad
old-fashioned silver brooch&mdash;the only silver ornament he
wore&mdash;such as the ladies of the Highland chieftains
in days of yore used to fasten their plaids with on
the left shoulder.  It was evidently an heir-loom.
Vain, apparently, of the beautiful but Herculean mould
of his neck, he wore his shirt collar folded back, cut
broad and massive, and lined with velvet of the same
colour as the shirt, and no neckcloth.
</p>

<p>
He had shaven his whiskers since I had seen him,
but wore a large jet-black mustache on his upper lip;
and a twisted Panama chain round his neck, supporting
an instrument made of some bright yellow hardwood,
highly polished, resembling a boatswain's pipe in
shape; the ventiges inlaid with gold.
</p>

<p>
His cap, of the same sort of leather as his belt, was
richly embroidered with a band of golden thistles
above the scoop, which was of tortoiseshell hooped in
with gold, coming very low down over his eyes, while
the top, like a hussar's, doubled over on the left side
of his head, where it ended in a massive tassel of gold
bullion.
</p>

<p>
He had buff gloves stuck in his belt; and his hands,
strong and muscular, but fair as a woman's, were
richly decorated with several valuable rings.
</p>

<p>
There had been <i>one</i> alteration in his appearance,
however, that I surmised he would have dispensed
with if he could; and that was a broad, deep, and
scarcely cicatrized scar down his sun-burnt cheek.
</p>

<p>
"My Kingston friend&mdash;proof positive," thought I.
</p>

<p>
I had never seen so handsome a man before, bronzed
almost black though he was by wind and fierce suns&mdash;such
perfect symmetry, conjoined with such muscle and
strength&mdash;such magnificent bodily proportions, with
so fine a face and forehead; and such pearl-white
teeth&mdash;but the fiend looked forth in the withering
sparkle of his hazel eye.
</p>

<p>
"The thistle!" said I to myself, as the old Scottish
brooch, and the general predominance of the national
emblem in his equipment attracted my attention;
"alas, can love of country, pervading as it is, still
linger in the bosom of a man <i>without</i> a country; of
one whose hand is against every man, and every man's
hand against him; <i>of the Tiger of the sea</i>!"  Yes,
like the dying lamp in the sepulchre, flickering after
its fellows have long been for ever quenched, whose
faint and uncertain beams seem still to sanctify, if
they cannot warm, the gloomy precincts, where all
beside is cold, and dark, and dead;&mdash;it was the last
ray of blessed light, gleaming through the mist of
surrounding rottenness and desolation&mdash;the last pale
halo of virtuous and holy feeling hovering to depart
from off the obdurate and heaven-scathed heart of the
God-forsaken PIRATE.
</p>

<p>
Unjust&mdash;unjust.  There <i>was another</i>&mdash;a kindlier,
a warmer, a steadier flame, that still burnt sun-bright
in that polluted tabernacle&mdash;all worthy of a purer
shrine&mdash;nor left it until, abreast of the spark of life
itself, it was shattered from his riven heart by the
dart of the Destroyer; and the dark and felon spirit,
whirled to its tremendous account on the shriek of
unutterable despair, crushed from him in his mortal
agony, as the dancing waves closed, howling and
hissing like water-fiends, over the murderer's grave.  But
let me not anticipate.
</p>

<p>
From his manner I could not say whether he knew
me or not.
</p>

<p>
"So you have put in here in distress," said he to
the master of the Moonbeam, glancing his eyes
upwards, where the people were at work at the head of
the mainmast.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," said Tooraloo, but before he could get
in another word, our <i>friend</i> was in the main-rigging
himself, and near the masthead.
</p>

<p>
"Eigh, eigh," sung out Palmneedle and Chip, who
were helping the carpenters and riggers aloft, "<i>what</i>
dis&mdash;<i>who</i> dis?" for the dog was following his master
like a monkey, <i>yaffing</i> and barking, and sprawling
with his feet through the ratlines&mdash;so each of the
negroes, seizing a rope, slid down on deck, and with
such vehemence, that they capsized on their backs,
cocking up their black trotters in the air, after a most
ludicrous fashion.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see&mdash;I see," said Wallace or Wilson,
descending, and swinging himself in on deck with the
grace of an Apollo; "masthead badly sprung&mdash;and
your chaps seem to be going clumsily enough about
their work too"&mdash;(a truth undoubtedly)&mdash;"I will
send you my carpenter's crew to lend a hand in
securing it."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, sir," said Toby, with much the sort
of expression and tone of a contrite culprit thanking
the hangman for adjusting the rope.
</p>

<p>
I was myself cruelly taken aback by such
unlooked-for civility, I will confess.
</p>

<p>
"But won't you step down and see my owner, sir?
he is in the cabin," quoth Tooraloo, in doubt what to
<i>say</i> or <i>do&mdash;metre again</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, certainly&mdash;no objections&mdash;but won't you go
first, sir?" said he, with one hand on the companion,
and politely indicating the ladder with the other;
cloaking thereby his real object, which was clearly
that he might not be taken at advantage.
</p>

<p>
Tooraloo and I went below on this, as one needs
must go when the devil drives, and were immediately
followed by the stranger.
</p>

<p>
Lennox was busy with some papers, and stooping
down over his open desk, with his pen crossed in his
mouth, when we entered&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"The captain of the Buenos Ayrean privateer, sir,"
said Tooraloo, stopping at the door and ushering him
in past him&mdash;jamming himself as flat as a flounder
against the door-post, as if to prevent even a fibre of
his clothing from touching the other.
</p>

<p>
Lennox looked up&mdash;his eyebrows instantly contracted,
his colour faded, and he became as pale as death.
The pen dropped unheeded from his lips, while the
large law paper that he held in his left hand, in which
he had apparently been writing, trembled like an
aspen leaf.&mdash;At length he ground out between his
teeth&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Hast thou found me&mdash;O mine enemy?"
</p>

<p>
"<i>Found you</i>," said the other, who had started, or
rather staggered back, equally overcome with extreme
surprise apparently, and nearly capsizing Tooraloo,
whose breath he fairly knocked out of his body against
the door-post with a grunt&mdash;"<i>Found you</i>, Saunders? why
if I have, it has not been in consequence of
<i>looking</i> for you, let me tell you <i>that</i>; for of all the
unexpected meetings that ever befell me, so help me
God&mdash;this is"&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Blaspheme not, William Adderfang&mdash;take not
<i>His</i> name into <i>your</i> mouth&mdash;you <i>have</i> found me, let
that suffice&mdash;and am <i>I</i> wrong in calling <i>you</i> my
<i>enemy&mdash;me</i>!&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Yes, Saunders&mdash;you <i>are</i> wrong&mdash;for with little
of your <i>profession</i>, and none of your <i>romance</i> and
<i>nonsense</i>, my boy, I will prove you are wrong at a fitting
opportunity&mdash;so there's my hand in the mean time,
man&mdash;there's my hand."&mdash;Lennox sprang back, as if
it had held a viper&mdash;"Heyday," said the other,
drawing himself up fiercely&mdash;"why I thought you might
have allowed bygones to <i>be</i> bygones at this time of
day&mdash;and surely I may cry quits now, after your
having scoured your knife against my ribs, at"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
Here he checked himself, and Lennox, making an
effort to resume his composure, shook Adderfang's
hand, but very much as one would shake a red-hot
poker&mdash;and then with no very good grace asked him
to sit down to breakfast, which the other instantly
did with apparent cordiality; and a deuced good one
he made too, chattering and doing the agreeable all
the while, as if he had been an old and intimate
acquaintance come on board to welcome us on our
arrival.  As for me Benjie&mdash;I freely confess that I
could not have told whether I was eating biscuit or
blancmange; nay, I verily believe you might have
palmed castor oil on me for coffee, and I never would
have noticed it.
</p>

<p>
"Adderfang&mdash;William Adderfang&mdash;the seducer of
Jessy Miller!" said I to myself; "here's a coil&mdash;the
villain who stabbed and robbed me at Havanna! the
master Wilson of Montego bay&mdash;the man with the
blunderbuss at Kingston.&mdash;Whew!  This devil of a
fellow to pounce upon us so unexpectedly, in an out
of the way place like San Andreas too! and with a
couple of whacking privateers, to give them still their
genteel name, with a hundred and fifty neat young
gentlemen at the fewest, I make no question, to back
him.  There's a climax of agreeables for you, if he
should recognise <i>me</i> now!  Come, this <i>does</i> account
with a vengeance for the floating notions that crossed
my mind at Mr Roseapple's&mdash;I was <i>sure</i> I had seen
him before."
</p>

<p>
Still, notwithstanding these <i>pleasant</i> dreams, I gave
in to circumstances, better than either of my two
shipmates, I fancy; for Lennox could eat but little, and
was evidently ill at ease&mdash;-as for the skipper he
gobbled mechanically&mdash;he could not help <i>that</i>; but I
noticed that he watched the stranger like a cat
watching a terrier, starting at his every motion; and when
he dropped his knife by accident on the floor and
stooped to pick it up, he held his breath until he saw
him at work at the biscuit and cold ham again; as if
he had considered there was a tolerable chance of his
giving him a progue with it <i>en passant</i>, just for the
fun of the thing as it were.
</p>

<p>
Gradually, however, I got more at ease, and was
noticing the extreme beauty of his short curling
auburn hair, now that his cap was thrown aside, with a
dash of premature grey here and there, like hoarfrost
in early autumn; and the noble ivory forehead, paler
by contrast with the bronzing of his face, and smooth
as monumental alabaster while his fierce spirit was in
calm, but crisping in a moment if his passions were
roused, like the ripple on the calm sea before the first
of the breeze; when he rose abruptly and led the way
from the cabin.
</p>

<p>
When we came on deck&mdash;Adderfang, or Wilson, or
Wallace, or whatever his name for the moment might
be&mdash;whistled "loud as the scream of the curlew," and
an armed boat immediately shoved out from under the
mangroves that grew on the small point or headland
near the cocoa-nut trees, and pulled towards us.
</p>

<p>
"Come," thought I, "he seems determined not to
trust too much to our forbearance either."&mdash;The boat
approached&mdash;it was apparently a very fast one, pulled
by four splendid fellows in neat white trowsers and
blue shirts, and all with cloth caps handsomely
embroidered.&mdash;They had their cutlasses buckled round
their waists by black belts, and there were four
marines in white jackets, two in the bow and two aft,
sitting with their muskets upright between their
knees.&mdash;The officer commanding the boat was a tall sallow
young man, very Yankee in appearance, dressed in a
blue uniform coat, and one epaulette, with uniform
buttons of some kind or another, so that altogether I
should have taken him for an officer in the United
States navy, had I accidentally met him.  He came
alongside.
</p>

<p>
"Mr Kerrick"&mdash;said Adderfang, who evidently,
but from what motive I could not tell, was most
desirous that we should be off from our anchorage as fast
as possible&mdash;"send Whitaker and four of his crew
from the Mosca"&mdash;this I guessed was the schooner,
although I afterwards found that she was no other
than the far-famed piratical Baltimore clipper, the
Snowflake, the terror of those seas&mdash;"and see&mdash;it is
to get all put to rights aloft there&mdash;the head of the
mainmast is badly sprung, you can tell him, and he
will know better than any of us what to bring."
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay, sir,"&mdash;said his subaltern, and without
more ado the boat shoved off again, not for the point,
however, but direct for the beach under Mr ***'s
house, where the officer landed, and the crew, leaving
a boat-keeper on the beach, began to skylark about;
but evidently they had their instructions never to
move so far away but that they should be able to reach
their boat again, <i>before we could</i>, if we had tried it.
From their lingo, those youths were all of them either
Americans or Englishmen, probably a mixture of both.
</p>

<p>
Presently Tooraloo, at his request or command, for
although the words were civil enough, the tone sounded
deuced like the latter, put Adderfang ashore in the
Moonbeam's boat; and under the idea that if there was
any danger toward, I ran as much risk where I was as
on the land, I asked to accompany him, so that I
might reconnoitre a bit by the way.  Accordingly, we
were walking up to Mr ***'s house, when I thought
I would diverge a little, in order to have a parley with
some of the boat's crew, who I had noticed converged
towards their own boat whenever they saw ours put
off; but before I could ask a question, the officer
before mentioned interposed, and with a great deal of
mock civility offered <i>his</i> services, if I wanted any thing.
I had no plea to avoid him, so I followed Adderfang
and Tooraloo to the house.
</p>

<p>
I now found, when I could look about me in the
daylight, that it was even a narrower tongue of land
on which the house stood than what I had imagined,
and that divided the bay where we were, from the
narrow land-locked creek where the two privateers were
at anchor.
</p>

<p>
Where I stood I looked right down upon them&mdash;they
lay in a beautiful little basin, with high precipitous
banks on the side next me, but with a smooth,
hard, and white beach on the opposite side, at the head
of the creek.  The entrance was very narrow, not
pistol-shot across.
</p>

<p>
Close to the shore, and immediately below me, lay
a large schooner, but I could only see her mastheads
and part of her bowsprit and fore-rigging, as she was
moored with her stern towards the high bank, so as to
present her broadside to the opening of the harbour,
and her bows to that of her consort, the little Midge,
that lay further off and close to the shore on the other
side of the creek, at right angles with the schooner, so
as to rake her if she had been carried, or enfilade any
boats coming in to attack her.  Both vessels had the
Buenos Ayrean flag and pennant flying; blue, white,
and blue, horizontally.
</p>

<p>
There were sentries along the beach; one being
advanced near to where I stood, who, when I made
demonstrations of descending, very civilly told me to
heave about, and <i>go back again</i>.  I remonstrated, and
said, "In the island of a friendly power I saw no right
that he, or any one else, had to set bounds to my
rambles."
</p>

<p>
He said he knew nought about <i>whose</i> island it <i>was</i>,
but he knew what <i>his</i> orders <i>were</i>; "so if I ventured,
he had given me fair warning."  With this, he threw
his musket across his body, and slapped the side of it
to see that the priming was all right.
</p>

<p>
"You are very obliging," said I; "but, pray, put
yourself to no inconvenience whatever on my account,
as I shall return."  And like the thief in the hen-roost,
I did go "back again."
</p>

<p>
By sunset that night our repairs were finished, and
a message came from Captain <i>Wallace</i>, that he
<i>expected</i> we would weigh and be off at daylight in the
morning&mdash;a hint that we were right willing to take,
I assure you.
</p>

<p>
The bearer further said, that he was ordered to leave
a small blue and yellow flag, that we were to hoist, if
we fell in with the Waterwraith, a schooner-tender
that he had cruising about the island, which would
prevent her from molesting us.
</p>

<p>
"Murder!  Are there three of them?&mdash;ho, ho,
hoo,"&mdash;trundled out our friend, Toby Tooraloo.
</p>

<p>
When we tried to get the carpenter's crew to take
payment as they were leaving us, they said they were
positively forbidden to do so, and their captain <i>was not
a man to be trifled with</i>.
</p>

<p>
"Why, so it appears," thought I.
</p>

<p>
Lennox was mute and melancholy, but we could
not better ourselves, so at length we retired to rest.
I could not sleep, however, so I was soon on deck
again, where I found both Lennox and Tooraloo before me.
</p>

<p>
And now it was that a most striking and inexplicable
incident occurred.  The voice of the wilderness,
every traveller knows, is many-toned and various; and
how often have not mysterious sounds broken on the
ear of the solitary look-out man, in the middle watch,
for which he never could account?  On the midnight
tossing of the melancholy main, who has not fancied
a "voice articulate" in the hoarse murmur, and often
wolf-like howl, of the approaching wave?  But listen!
</p>

<p>
"Do you hear that, sir?" said Lennox to me, so
soon as I came on deck.  I listened, and heard a low
moaning noise that came off the land, swelling and
dying away on the fitful gusts of the <i>terral</i>, like the
deepest tones of an Eolian harp.  It sank and sank, and
was just melting away, and becoming inaudible
altogether, when it seemed to blend into a ponderous and
solemn sound, that floated down to us on the fitful
breeze, like the midnight tolling of a deep-toned
cathedral bell, or the gradually increasing tremulous
boom of a large gong.
</p>

<p>
"I do," said I; "and hark&mdash;is that a bell?&mdash;no, it
cannot be, yet the sound is most like."  Again we all
listened eagerly.  But the sound had ceased, and we
were about commencing our pendulum walk on the
confined deck, when once more it came off, and in the
very strongest of the swell, the same ringing sound
swung three times over us distinctly on the night air.
"Who struck the bell there?" I sung out, a good
deal startled&mdash;no answer&mdash;we all then passed
forward; <i>there was no one on deck</i>&mdash;"very strange,"
said I&mdash;"what can it be?"
</p>

<p>
"My dregy,"[<a id="chap11fn1text"></a><a href="#chap11fn1">1</a>] said poor Lennox, with a faint laugh.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p class="footnote">
<a id="chap11fn1"></a>
[<a href="#chap11fn1text">1</a>] <i>Anglice</i>, dirge.
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Davy Jones&mdash;Davy Jones&mdash;the devil&mdash;the devil&mdash;the
devil&mdash;hooro, hooro, hooro!" quoth Tooraloo.
</p>

<p>
Whatever it was we heard neither sound again, but
they had scarcely ceased when a small glow-worm
coloured spark, precisely like the luminous appearance
of a piece of decayed fish, flitted about the
foretopgallant yard and royal-masthead, now on the truck,
now on either yardarm, like a bee on the wing, during
the time one might count twenty, and then vanished.
</p>

<p>
"And there goes his worship visibly; why the air
must be fearfully surcharged with electricity to be
sure," said I Benjie.  We were all astonishment&mdash;but
the plot was only thickening.
</p>

<p>
"How loud and hollow the sound of the surf is,
Lennox," I continued.  "And I have never seen
such a strong phosphorescence of the sea as to-night.
Look there, the breakers on the reef are like a ridge
of pale fire.  Why, here are a whole bushelful of
portents, more numerous than those which preceded the
death of Cæsar, as I am a gentleman."
</p>

<p>
The Dominie did not relish this sort of talking, I
noticed.  "It may be no laughing matter to some of
us before all is done, sir."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, nonsense; but there may be <i>bad weather
brewing</i>, Master Lennox."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, sir," responded the poor fellow, speaking
very fast, as if desirous of cloaking his weakness,&mdash;"yes,
sir, we shall have a breeze soon, I fear."
</p>

<p>
"No doubt&mdash;no doubt."
</p>

<p>
"There's a squall coming&mdash;there's a squall
coming&mdash;ho, ho, he"&mdash;rumbled Toby.
</p>

<p>
"Where&mdash;where?"
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;right out there."
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo&mdash;that's the reef&mdash;the white breakers&mdash;eh,
what?&mdash;why it moves, sure enough&mdash;it <i>is</i> sliding
across the mouth of the bay&mdash;there, whew!"&mdash;as a
blue light was burned in the offing, disclosing
distinctly enough a small schooner standing in for the
land, under easy sail, plunging heavily, and kicking
up a curl of white foam on the black and rapidly
increasing swell.  Presently all was dark again, and a
night-signal was made on board of her with lanterns.
</p>

<p>
"Waterwraith, as sure as can be!" said I; "but
why does he bother with blue lights and signals? would
it not be easier to send in a boat at once?"
</p>

<p>
"Too much sea on&mdash;too much sea on," quoth
Tooraloo; "and no one would venture to thread the
reefs and run in in a night like this; so he has no
way of communicating but by signal."
</p>

<p>
After a little we noticed the small white wreath
steal back again like a puff of vapour, and, crossing
the bay, vanish beyond the bluff opposite the
cocoanut trees.
</p>

<p>
"There&mdash;she has said her say, whatever that may
have been, and has hove about again, sure enough."
</p>

<p>
We saw no more of her that night, and with the
early dawn, we were once more under weigh, sliding
gently out of the small haven.
</p>

<p>
I am sure I could not tell how the little beauty
slipt along so speedily, for the collapsed sails were
hanging wet and wrinkled from the spars, so light
was the air; and as we began to draw out into the
offing, and to feel the heave of the swell, the motion
of the vessel made them <i>speak</i> and flutter, the water
dashing down in showers, at every rumbling flap of
the soaked and clouded canvass.
</p>

<p>
The night had been throughout very hot and
sultry, the sky as dark as pitch, and now the day
broke very loweringly.  Thick masses of heavy
clouds rolled in from the offing, whirling overhead
like the smoke from a steamer's chimney-stack.  It
lightened in the south east, now and then, and as we
drew out from the land, the distant grumble of the
thunder blended hoarsely with the increasing noise of
the surf, as the swell, at one time, surged howling up
the cavernous indentations on the ironbound coast,
ebbing, with a loud shoaling rush, like a rapid river
over shallows; at another, pitched in sullen <i>thuds</i>
against the rocks, and reverberated from their iron
ribs with a deafening roar, that made air and sea
tremble again.  As we got out of the bay, the
growling of the sea increased, and came more hollow,
the noise being reflected from the land in sounding
echoes.
</p>

<p>
Close to, the waves rolled on in long sluggish
undulations; in colour and apparent consistency as if
they had been molten lead; the very divers that we
disturbed on their dull grey surface, ran along, leaving
dotted trails, as if it had been semi-fluid, or as if
some peculiarity in the atmosphere had rendered them
unable to raise themselves into the murky air.
</p>

<p>
Shoals of sea-mews, and other waterfowl, were
floating lightly, and twinkling with their white wings
in the cold grey dawning, as we crept through
amongst them and disturbed them, like clusters of
feathers scattered on the glass-like heaving of the
dark water, afraid apparently to leave the vicinity of
the land; every now and then the different groups
would take up in succession a loud screaming, like a
running fire passing along the line, when all would be
still again.  Birds that hovered between an English
martin and Mother Cary's chickens in appearance,
kept dipping, and rising, and circling all round us; and
the steady flying pelican skimmed close to the tops of
the swell, on poised and motionless wing, as straight
as a pointblank cannon shot; while a shoal of
porpoises were dappling the surface to windward, with
their wheel-like gambols.
</p>

<p>
"What the deuce makes the fish jump so this
morning?" said I to Lennox, as several dolphins
sprang into the air ahead of the Moonbeam&mdash;"What
is that?"&mdash;a puff of white vapour, with a noise for
all the world like a blast of steam, rose close to us.
</p>

<p>
"The blowing of a whale, sir;" and immediately
thereafter the back of the monster, like a black reef,
or the bottom of a capsized launch, was hove out of
the water, and then disappeared slowly with a strong
eddy; his subaqueous track being indicated on the
surface by a long line of bubbles, and <i>swirling</i> ripples,
like the wake of a ship cleaving the water rapidly,
always growing stronger and more perceptible as he
neared the surface to breathe again.
</p>

<p>
"Ah! that accounts for it; there again he rises."
</p>

<p>
"Yes," rejoined he; "but see how he shoves out
into the offing, although the shoals he is after are
running in shore.  As sure as a gun, he is conscious
of the danger of being embayed if the weather
becomes what I fear it will be soon."
</p>

<p>
"Lots of indications that a close-reefed topsail
breeze, at all events, is not a thousand miles off,
Master Lennox," said I.
</p>

<p>
Out at sea, the swell tumbled most tumultuously;
the outline of the billows seen with startling clearness
by the flashes of lightning, on the verge of the
horizon; while nearer at hand, the waves began to break
in white foam, and roll towards us with hoarse and
increasing growls; although the light air that was
drifting us out came off the land, and consequently
blew in the precisely contrary direction from whence
the swell was proceeding.  Threatening as the
weather looked, right off the cocoa-nut trees at the point,
we perceived a boat, rising and disappearing on the
ridges, and in the hollows of the sea, like a black buoy.
</p>

<p>
"So&mdash;an ominous looking morning, Toby.  Still,
our friends of the blue, white, and blue bunting, are
determined to see us fairly off it seems; for there is
their boat watching us till the last, you see."
</p>

<p>
"So I perceive, sir," said the skipper; "but if it
were not for their neighbourhood, Mr Brail, I would
have recommended Mr Lennox to stay where he
was until the weather cleared; but there is no help
for it now."
</p>

<p>
The morning wore on.  We were now sliding
along shore about a mile from the beach, and our
view down to the westward, as we approached the
southernmost point of the island, began to open.
</p>

<p>
The higher part of the land was quite clear; the
outline, indeed, dangerously distinct and <i>near-like</i>,
according to my conception; but the white clouds
that floated over it when we first started, like a sea of
wool, and which usually rise and exhale under the
morning sun, had in the present case rolled off to the
southward, and lay heaped up in well-defined masses,
like the smoke of an engagement floating sluggishly
in the thunder-calmed air, close to the surface of the
water.
</p>

<p>
I was admiring this uncommon appearance, not
without some awkward forebodings, when a flaw of
wind off the land rent the veil in the middle, or
rather opened an arch in it, at the end of whose
gloomy vista rose the island as a dark background,
and suddenly disclosed a small schooner lying to, so
clear and model-like under the canopy of vapour, that
I can compare it to nothing more aptly than a
sea-scene in a theatre.
</p>

<p>
"Hillo!" said I, "what vessel is that down to
leeward there?  It must be our friend of last night, I
take it.  Hand me up the glass, if you please."
</p>

<p>
"Where's the small flag&mdash;where's the small flag?"
sung out Toby.
</p>

<p>
"Here, sir," said Chip the negro, as he bent it on
to the signal haulyards.
</p>

<p>
"Then hoist away," rejoined Tooraloo.  "That
is the Waterwraith down to leeward, sir, to a certainty."
</p>

<p>
"Sure enough," I replied; "I hope he will let us
go without overhauling us.  I am not at all amorous
of the society of those gentry&mdash;quite enough of it in
the bay yonder, Toby."
</p>

<p>
The moment she saw us, she made sail towards us,
but hove about so soon as she saw the signal, which
she answered with a similar flag, and then stood in for
the land again.
</p>

<p>
In a minute, the mist once more boiled over her,
and she disappeared.
</p>

<p>
It crept slowly on towards where we lay, for it was
again nearly calm, although the threatening appearances
in the sky and on the water continued to deepen,
and was just reaching us, when we heard a cannon-shot
from the thickest of it.
</p>

<p>
"Heyday&mdash;what does that indicate, Lennox?"
</p>

<p>
"Some signal to the other villains in the cove,
sir"&mdash;and then, in a low tone as he turned
away&mdash;"but to me it sounds like a knell."
</p>

<p>
Another gun&mdash;another&mdash;<i>and another</i>&mdash;"Some fun
going on there at all events," said I.
</p>

<p>
The breeze now freshened, and the fog-bank blew
off and vanished; when lo! our spectral friend the
Waterwraith re-appeared, but on the other tack this
time, about two miles to the westward of us, with a
large schooner, that had hitherto been also concealed
by the fog, sticking in his skirts, and blazing away at
him.  In ten minutes they both tacked again.  They
had now the regular sea-breeze strong from the
eastward, and were close-hauled, under all the sail they
could carry, on the starboard tack.
</p>

<p>
"Confound it," said Lennox, who was now beside
me, "we seem to have dropped into a nest of them&mdash;it
will be another privateer."
</p>

<p>
"Then why is she firing at the small one?" said I.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, some make-believe manoeuvre," said he.
</p>

<p>
But I had taken a long look, and was by no means
of this opinion.  The smallest vessel, the schooner
we had first seen, would evidently go far to windward
of us, but the larger was right in our track; so avoiding
her, if we stood on as we were doing, was out of the
question.
</p>

<p>
"However, better take our chance with this chap
out here, than run back into the lion's mouth," said I.
</p>

<p>
So we kept on our course, having now got the
breeze also, and steering large, so as to go a-head of
the biggest of the two, unless he stood away to
intercept us.  We were beginning to get over our fears,
and to think he was going to take no notice of us
after all, and had brought him end on, when a flash
spurted from his bows, and a swirl of white smoke
rolled down to leeward.
</p>

<p>
"He has fired at us," said I, as the shot hopped
along the water close to us.
</p>

<p>
"Then hoist away our colours," said Lennox;
"let us know the worst of it at once."
</p>

<p>
The next shot pitched over the lee quarter, and
knocked one of our hencoops to pieces, unexpectedly
liberating the feathered prisoners.  Toby's lingo&mdash;for
he was now in an ecstasy of fear&mdash;became very
amusing.  "Now, men, rouse aft the foresheet, and do
some of you catch that duck.  Clap on the topsail
haulyards&mdash;mind the capon&mdash;topgallant and royal
haulyards also&mdash;bless me, the turkey is overboard&mdash;why,
that royal is all aback&mdash;chickens&mdash;topgallantsail
is not set at all&mdash;both geese&mdash;now a small pull of
the boom sheet.  You blood of a black&mdash;female dog"&mdash;to
Chip, the negro carpenter&mdash;"peak purchase; belay
all that&mdash;murder! if both the guinea birds are not
over into the sea."
</p>

<p>
"Ha!" said I, "I thought so&mdash;there goes the
blue ensign and pennant.  He is a man-of-war, thank
Heaven!"
</p>

<p>
"Heave to, captain," cried Lennox.
</p>

<p>
But just as we had shortened sail preparatory thereto,
the schooner ranged alongside, and, without a word
spoken, fired a broadside of round and grape slap into
us, whereby Lennox himself and other two poor devils
were wounded, and our rigging considerably cut up.
</p>

<p>
"That's the Spider, for a thousand," said I; "but
what the deuce can he mean by firing at us?"
</p>

<p>
"I can't tell, but I don't think it is the Spider,
sir," said Lennox; "so haul in the sheets, and keep
by the wind again, captain&mdash;quick man, quick."  And
away we staggered once more, running in for San
Andreas on a bow line as fast as we could split; but
the large schooner stuck close at our heels, firing
away like fury, while the little Waterwraith promptly
availed himself of this interlude, by tacking, and
standing off the land again.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Toby, you and your owner are both mad&mdash;what
better of it will you make by running back?"
</p>

<p>
Lennox had gone below to have his arm bound up
by this time.
</p>

<p>
"You would not have us tack, and get another
broadside, sir?  Besides, look at the weather, sir? even
putting the schooner out of the question," said
Tooraloo.
</p>

<p>
"Ah, as to the weather, <i>there</i> indeed you have
some reason."
</p>

<p>
Toby saw his advantage.  "Surely you would not
have us keep the sea in such a threatening morning,
even without such company, sir?"
</p>

<p>
The prudence of this was becoming every moment
more evident, as the dark waves were now breaking
all round us, and the water was roughening and
whitening to windward; it was clear we should have
a sneezer before long.
</p>

<p>
Thanks to our excellent sailing, we gradually
dropped the schooner, until we were out of gunshot&mdash;we
were presently up with the island, and ran in, and
once more came-to in our old corner; but the
man-of-war kept in the offing, apparently to reconnoitre.
We found a privateer's boat at our old anchorage,
most like the one that had seen us off in the
morning.  It was coming out with Adderfang himself in
it&mdash;all his gay dress thrown aside&mdash;he had neither
hat nor cap on, nor shoes, but wore a simple blue
shirt, and canvass trowsers; the former open at the
breast, disclosing his muscular and hairy chest, and
with the sleeves rolled up to his armpits.  He was
covered with dust and perspiration, and had evidently
been toiling fiercely at something or other with his
own hands.  He was armed to the teeth, as were his
boat's crew.
</p>

<p>
"What brings you back, Mr Brail?" said he, his
brows knit, his eyes flashing fire, his face pale as death,
and his lips blue and trembling, evidently in a
paroxysm of the most savage fury; "what brings you
back? and what vessel is that astern of you?  No
concealment, sir; I am not in a mood to trifle."
</p>

<p>
"She is a man-of-war, captain," at this critical
juncture sung out the tall, sallow man, who had been
in command of the boat on the previous day, from the
top of the cliffs, where he had perched himself like on
ugly cormorant, with a glass in his hand.
</p>

<p>
"I thought so," said the pirate with great bitterness;
"I thought so.  Fool! to believe that any thing
but treachery was to come from that whelp!  Walpole&mdash;here,
men, lend me a hand."
</p>

<p>
And before we could interfere, he was on board,
with four desperadoes as powerful almost as himself.
I had never witnessed such devilish ferocity before in
any animal, human or inhuman, except in his
worship's dog, who was jumping and foaming about the
deck as if he had been possessed by a kindred devil,
or had been suffering under hydrophobia; only
waiting apparently for the holding up of his master's
little finger to lunch on Toby Tooraloo, or breakfast
on me Benjie.
</p>

<p>
"Here, Matamoro, here," roared our <i>amigo</i>, indicating
the companion to this beautiful pet, who thereupon
glanced down it like a ferret after a rat; and
from the noise below it was clear he had attacked
Lennox.  Adderfang and two of his men instantly
followed, and presently the poor dominie, bleeding
from his recent wound, and torn by the dog in the
shoulder, was dragged up the ladder, like a carcass in
the shambles, bound hand and foot, and hove bodily
into the boat.  I was petrified with horror.  The poor
fellow, in the midst of all the misery of this his
closing scene, gave me one parting look as he passed&mdash;one
last concentrated look of the most intense wo.  I
never shall forget the expression: it seemed to say, a
thousand times more forcibly than language could
have expressed&mdash;"Do you believe what I told you at
Havanna to have been a dream now, Mr Brail?"
</p>

<p>
The next moment he cried aloud and imploringly
to the demon in human shape, into whose power he
had indeed, against all probability, fallen, "Where
are you going to take me, Mr Adderfang?"  The
only answer he gave him was a brutal kick on the
mouth.  "I have had no communication with the
schooner in the offing.  Don't you see I am wounded
by her shot?  I have had another blow.  Mind what
you do, or you shall repent this," cried the poor fellow
again as they dragged him along.
</p>

<p>
"Let him go," I sung out, as they were about
shoving off.  "Men, stand by me.  Release him,
you murdering villain!  Where would you take him
to, you bucaniering scoundrel?"
</p>

<p>
"To hell&mdash;and mind you don't keep him company&mdash;to
meet the fate of a spy! one that has brought an
enemy on me, when I was willing to have forgotten
and forgiven.  Let go the painter, sir&mdash;let go, I say."
</p>

<p>
And he made a blow with his cutlass, that missed
me, but severed the rope; and as if the action had
lashed him into uncontrollable rage, he instantly drew
a pistol, and fired it at my head.  The bullet flew
wide of its mark, however, but down dropped Toby
Tooraloo; while Adderfang shouted,&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Shove off, men&mdash;give way for your lives&mdash;pull."
</p>

<p>
And in a twinkling the boat disappeared behind the
small cocoa-nut tree point.
</p>

<p>
"Good God, sir," said Toby, lying flat on his
back, where I thought he had been shot, "what is
to be done?  They will murder Mr Lennox."
</p>

<p>
"Very like; but I thought you were killed
yourself, Toby."
</p>

<p>
"No, sir&mdash;no, sir&mdash;only knocked down by the
wind of the shot, sir&mdash;wind of the shot, sir&mdash;ho, ho,
hoo!"
</p>

<p>
"Wind of a pistol bullet no bigger than a pea?
For shame, Toby!&mdash;fright, man, fright."
</p>

<p>
But we had no time for reflection; for the schooner
was now right off the mouth of the small bay,
apparently clear for action.  She was a man-of-war,
beyond all question; and I was still convinced she
was the Spider.  Presently she hauled round the
cocoa-nut-covered cape, and took up a position, so
far as I could judge, opposite the mouth of the creek.
Oh, what would I not have given to have been on
board of her!  But this was impossible.
</p>

<p>
The blue and yellow private signal, that Adderfang
had sent us, and which had been kept flying
until this moment, was now hauled down, close past
my nose.
</p>

<p>
"Spider!&mdash;to be sure that is the Spider; and no
wonder she should have peppered us so beautifully,
Master Toby, with such a voucher for our honesty
aloft; with this same accursed signal flying, that she
had seen the Waterwraith hoist.  There! the
murder is out.  What conclusion could De Walden have
come to, but that we were birds of a feather?"
</p>

<p>
"Ay, ay&mdash;true enough&mdash;hooro! hooro! hooro!"
rumbled Tobias, sweating like a pig with downright
fear.
</p>

<p>
Tooraloo and I now hurried ashore in the boat,
without well knowing what to do, and ran to the
ridge, to see, if possible, what became of Lennox.
The boat wherein he was, sheered for a moment
alongside the schooner, the Mosca, apparently giving
orders, and then pulled directly for the Midge, where
the people got out, dragging poor Lennox along with
them.
</p>

<p>
"Heaven have mercy on us!" I exclaimed,
shuddering.  "What can they be going to do with the
poor fellow?"
</p>

<p>
I was not long in doubt; for the moment they
got on the deck, the barbarians cast him headlong
down the main hatchway, which was immediately
battened down, and then hoisted in the boat.
</p>

<p>
The crew of the schooner below me, whose deck,
as already described, was hid by the high bank, were
now busy, I could hear, in clearing for action; and
several of them were piling up large stones, and
making fast hawsers from her mastheads to trees at
the top of the cliff near where I stood, that, in the
event of her being carried below, it should be
impossible to tow her out,&mdash;while the stones would prove
formidable missiles when launched from above.  I
also perceived a boat at the foam-fringed sandy spit
opposite the cocoa-nut trees, that formed one side of
the narrow entrance, whose crew were filling bags
with sand, and forming a small battery, with
embrasures, for two carronades, that had been already
landed, and lay like two black seeds on the white beach.
</p>

<p>
The Spider had by this time tacked, and stood out
to sea again, apparently astonished at the extent of
the preparations to receive her.  After a brief space,
she hove about, and in the very middle and thickest
of a squall, accompanied by heavy thunder and vivid
lightning, dashed gallantly into the harbour; but just
as she came abreast of the battery, she took the
ground&mdash;she had tailed on the bank, and hung.  Her
masts in a moment flew forward, and bent as if they
would have gone over the bows, the rigging and
canvass shaking and flapping convulsively; but the
sound spars instantly recovered their upright position,
with a violent jerk that made every thing rattle again,
like the recoil of two tough yew staves when the
bowstrings snap.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Master Henry, you are in for it," thought I.
</p>

<p>
This was the signal for the battery to open; but
the grape from the Spider soon silenced it.
However, the broadside of the schooner beneath me was
raking her with terrible effect, I could see; while
they were unable to get a single gun to bear.  At
length, by lightening her aft, her broadside was got
round, so as to return the fire; and now the hellish
uproar began in earnest.  For several minutes the
smoke, that rose boiling amongst the trees at the top
of the cliff, concealed all below.  I could neither see
nor hear any thing but the glancing spouts of red
flame, and thunder of the cannon; the bright sparkles
and sharp rattle of the small arms blending with the
yelling and shouting of the combatants: but the
clearing away of the next squall made every thing
once more comparatively clear.  The battery, I
perceived, was again manned, and galling the Spider
most awfully; but just as I looked, a boat's crew from
her stormed it, driving those who manned it along
the sand-bank towards where the Midge lay; and
then, having spiked the guns, returned on board.  The
freshening breeze now forced the Spider over the
shoal, and she entered the creek.  Giving the Midge
a broadside in passing, in the hope of disabling her,
so as to leave nothing to cope with but the Mosca;
but the sting was not to be so easily taken out of
the little vixen.  Presently the Spider anchored by
the stern, within pistol-shot of the schooner, right
athwart his bows, and began to blaze away again.
</p>

<p>
The cheers from her increased, and the shouts
of the pirates subsided; but the felucca, which had
slipped on being fired at, and warped out between
the Spider and the mouth of the cove, now dropped
anchor again, with a spring on her cable; and from
this vantage ground, began to dash broadside after
broadside of round and grape right into her
antagonist's stern, enfilading her most fearfully.
</p>

<p>
I could make nothing out of what was going on
all this time on the Spider's deck; for although I
now and then caught a glimpse of it, during the
moments when the strength of the gale cleared away
the smoke, and could dimly discern the turmoil of
fighting men, and the usual confusion of a ship's
deck during a hot engagement; yet the moment my
optics began to <i>individualize</i>, as Jonathan says, the
next discharge would whirl its feathery wreaths aloft,
and hide every thing again half way up the masts,
that stood out like two blasted pines piercing the
mountain mists.
</p>

<p>
Hillo! my eyes deceive me, <i>or</i> DOWN <i>goes the
blue ensign on board of the Spider</i>!!!  So, fare
thee well, Henry de Walden; well I wot, my noble
boy, you have not lived to see it&mdash;Strike to
pirates!&mdash;No! no!  <i>How</i> could I be such a fool?  It is
but the peak haulyards that are shot away, and there
goes a gallant fellow aloft to reeve or splice them
again, amidst a storm of round, and grape, and
musket balls.  He cannot manage it, nor can the gaff be
lowered, for something jams about the throat haulyards,
which he struggles in vain to overhaul&mdash;then
let it stick; for now he slides down the drooping
spar, to knot the peak haulyards <i>there</i>.  Look how
he sways about, as the gaff is violently shaken by the
flapping of the loosened sail; for both vangs and
brails are gone.  Mind you are not jerked overboard,
my fine fellow&mdash;murder! he drops like lead into the
pall of smoke beneath, shot dead by the enemy's
marksmen.  Another tries it&mdash;better luck this time,
for he reaches the gaff-end, and there the peak rises
slowly but steadily into the air once more, the
ensign flashing out of the smoke that had concealed it,
like the blue lightning from a thundercloud, and once
more streaming gallantly in the wind.  Whew! the
unfortunate bunting clips into it again to
leeward, vanishing like a dark-winged sea-bird dipping
into a fogbank&mdash;the ensign haulyards are shot
away&mdash;worse and more of it&mdash;down goes the maintopmast
next, royal mast, pennant and all; snapped off by a
cannon-ball as clean as a fishing-rod&mdash;no fun in all
this, any how&mdash;Well done, my small man&mdash;a <i>wee</i>
middy, in the very nick, emerges from the sulphureous
cloud below, with a <i>red</i> ensign, to replace the blue
one, fluttering and flaming around him, as if he were
on fire.  He clambers up the mainrigging, and seizes
the meteor there&mdash;<i>seizes!</i> nay, he <i>nails</i> it to the
mast.  He descends again, and disappears, leaving
the flag flaring in the storm from the masthead, as if
the latter had been a blazing torch.
</p>

<p>
I began now seriously to fear that De Walden was
getting too much of it between the Midge and the
schooner, when I saw fire and thick smoke rise up
near me, as if bursting from the afterpart of the
latter vessel; and, at the moment, the increasing gale
broke the Spider's spring, that a shift of wind had also
compelled her to use, to keep her in her station,&mdash;so
that, from being athwart his hawse, she now swung
with her bows slantingly towards her opponent's
broadside, and lay thus for some time, again terribly
galled by a heavy raking fire, until the men in the
Mosca were literally scorched from their guns by the
spreading flames.
</p>

<p>
I could now see that the pirate crew were leaving
her; so I slipped down near the edge of the cliff, to
have a better view of what was going on beneath, but
keeping as much out of the line of fire as possible.
</p>

<p>
The schooner's hull was by this time enveloped in
smoke and waving red flames, and her fire silenced;
while the Spider, taking advantage of the lull, was
peppering the little Midge, who was returning the
compliment manfully; her broadside, from the parting
of the warp, being by this time opposed to hers.
</p>

<p>
The crew of the Mosca now abandoned her in two
boats, one of which succeeded in reaching the Midge;
while the other made for the shore on the opposite
side of the creek.
</p>

<p>
Seeing me on the ridge, the rogues in the latter
stopped, and faced about&mdash;"Heaven and earth, what
is that?"  I was cast down sprawling on my back.
</p>

<p>
"What dat is&mdash;what dat is, do massa say?" quoth
honest Quacco's voice at this juncture; "Massa no
was shee one whole platoon fire at him?  If massa
will keep walloping his arms about like one breezemill,
and make grimace, and twist him body dis side
and dat side, like one monkey&mdash;baboon you call&mdash;and
do all sort of foolis ting for make dem notice
him, massa most not be sorprise if dey soot at him."  And
true enough, in the intensity of my excitement,
the strong working of my spirit had moved my
outward man as violently as that of a Johnny Raw
witnessing his first prize-fight.  If my contortions
were of any kindred to those the sable Serjeant
illustrated his speech by, I must have made rather an
amusing exhibition.  "Look, if two of dem bullet no
tell in de tree here, just where massa was stand up,
when I was take de liberty of pull him down on him
battam; beg pardon for name soch unpoliteful place
before massa."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, trusty armourer," cried I Benjie.  But
the gale, that now "aside the shroud of battle cast,"
blowing almost a hurricane, again veered round a
little, and the Midge was under weigh, near the mouth
of the creek, standing out to sea.
</p>

<p>
The weather was, indeed, getting rapidly worse&mdash;the
screaming sea-birds flew in, like drifts of snow;
scarcely distinguishable from the driving foamflakes.
The scud came past in soaking wreaths, like flashes of
white vapour from the safety-valve of a steam boiler.
Suddenly the wind fell to a dead calm; not a breath
fanned us; not a leaf stirred; the rain-drops glittered
on the pale-green velvet of the ragged, and
ever-twittering, but now motionless leaves of the plantain,
like silver globules frozen there; the reports of the
guns grew sharper in the lull, the cries shriller, and the
general tumult and uproar of the conflict swelled
fearfully; while the white smoke rose up, shrouding the
vessels and entire cove from my sight.
</p>

<p>
The clouds above us, surcharged with fire and water,
formed a leaden coloured arch over the entrance to the
cove, that spanned the uproar of dark white-crested
waves, boiling and rolling in smoky wreaths, and
lancing out ragged shreds from their lower edges, that
shot down and shortened like a fringe of streamers,
from which the forked lightning <i>crankled</i> out every
now and then clear and bright.
</p>

<p>
To the right hand, directly over the cocoa-nut
trees, these fibres, or shreds of clouds, were in the
most active motion, and began to twirl and whisk
round into a spinning black tube, shaped like the
trunk of an elephant; the widest end blending into
the thickest of the arch above, while the lower
swayed about, with an irregular but ponderous oscillation;
lengthening and stretching towards the trees, one
moment in a dense column, as if they had <i>attracted</i>
it, and the next contracting with the speed of light, as
if it had as suddenly been <i>repelled</i> by them, leaving
only a transparent phantom-like track of dark shreds in
the air, to show where it had shrunk from.  There,
it lengthens again, as if it once more felt an affinity
for the sharp spiculæ of the leaves, that seem to erect
themselves to meet it.  It almost touched them&mdash;flash&mdash;the
electric fluid sparked out and <i>up</i>, either
from the cocoa-nut trees themselves, or through them
as conductors from the sandy spit on which they grew.
I saw it distinctly; but the next moment the pent
gale, as if it had burst some invisible barrier that
confined it, gushed down as suddenly as it had taken off,
and stronger than before.  I was blinded and almost
suffocated by the heaviest shower ever dashed by wind
in the face of mortal man&mdash;the <i>debris</i>, so to speak, of
the vanished waterspout; I can compare it to nothing
but being exposed to the jet of a fire-engine.
</p>

<p>
A column of dense black smoke, thickly starred
with red sparks, now boiled up past the edge of the
cliff under me&mdash;presently it became streaked with
tongues of bright hissing flame, which ran up the
rigging, diverging along every rope, as if it had been a
galvanic wire, twisting, serpent-like, round the
Mosca's masts and higher spars, and licking the wet furled
sails like boa-constrictors fitting their prey to be
devoured.  See how the fire insinuates itself into the
dry creases of the canvass, driving out the moisture
from the massive folds in white steam; now the sails
catch in earnest&mdash;they drop in glowing flakes of tinder
from the yards&mdash;there the blue and white pennant
and ensign are scorched away, and blow off in tiny
flashes; while in the lulls of the gale we distinctly
hear the roaring and crackling of the fire, as it rages
in the hull of the doomed vessel below.  "I say,
Quacco, mind we don't get a hoist, my man&mdash;see we
be not too near&mdash;there, don't you hear how the guns
go off as the metal gets heated, for there is not a soul
on board?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh dear! oh dear&mdash;see that poor little fellow,
sir&mdash;ho! ho! ho!" rumbled Tobias Tooraloo, who
all this time was lying flat on his stomach beside me,
with his head a little raised, turtle-fashion.  A poor
boy belonging to the pirate schooner had been caught
and cut off by the fire when aloft, and was now
standing on the head of the mainmast with one arm round
the topmast, and waving his cap in the most beseeching
manner at us with the other hand&mdash;the rising
smoke seemed to be stifling him, at least we could not
hear his cries; at length the fire reached him, when
after several abortive attempts to climb higher up, he
became confused, and slung himself by a rope to the
masthead, without seeming to know what he was
about&mdash;he then gradually drooped, and drooped, the
convulsive action of his head and limbs becoming
more and more feeble; merciful Providence! the flames
reach him&mdash;his hair is on fire, and his clothes; a last,
strong, and sudden struggle for an instant, and then
he hung motionless across the rope like a smirched
and half-burned fleece.
</p>

<p>
It never rains but it pours.  "Hark! an earthquake!"
and, as if a volcano had burst forth beneath
our feet, at this instant of time the pirate schooner
under the cliff blew up with an explosion that shook
earth, air, and water&mdash;shooting the pieces of burning
wreck in every direction, that hissed like meteors
through the storm, and fell thickly all around us.
</p>

<p>
The Midge, the Midge&mdash;she slides out of the
smoke!  See! she gains the offing.
</p>

<p>
But the Avenger of Blood is behind; for the Spider
had now cleared the harbour's mouth, and was in hot
pursuit.  The felucca with her sails&mdash;a whole constellation
of shot-holes in them&mdash;double reefed, tearing
and plunging through it; her sharp stem flashing up
the water into smoke, in a vain attempt to weather
the sandy point.&mdash;"Won't do, my boy; you cannot,
carry to it as you will, clear the land as you are
standing; you <i>must</i> tack soon, unless you mean to <i>jump</i>
the little beauty over it."  As I spoke, she hove about
and stood across the schooner, exchanging broadsides
gallantly.  "Well done, little one."  The Spider
tacked also, and stood after her&mdash;a gun!&mdash;another!&mdash;both
replied to by the felucca; the musketry peppering
away all the while from each vessel; the tiny
white puffs instantly obliterated by the
foam-drift&mdash;and now neither fired a shot.
</p>

<p>
The gale at this moment came down in thunder;
all above as black as night, all below as white as wool.
The Spider shortens sail just in time&mdash;the Midge not
a pistol-shot ahead on the weatherbow.  See, the squall
strikes her&mdash;her tall lateen sail shines through the
more than twilight darkness and the driving rain and
spray, like a sea-bird's wing.  Mercy! how she lies
over!  She sinks in the trough of the sea!&mdash;Now she
rises again, and breasts it gallantly!&mdash;There! that's
over her bodily; her sails are dark, and sea-washed
three parts up.  Look! how the clear green water, as
she lurches, pours out of the afterleech of the sail like
a cascade!  Now! she is buried again; no! buoyant
as cork&mdash;she dances over it like a wild-duck.  See! how
she tips up her round stern, and slides down the
liquid hollow; once more she catches the breeze on
the opposite rise of the sea; her sails tearing her along
up the watery acclivity, as if they would drag the spars
out of her.  Now she rushes on the curl of the wave,
with her bows and a third of her keel hove out
into the air, as if she were going to shoot across,
like a flying fish, into the swelling bosom of the
next sea.  Once more she is hove on her beam-ends,
and hid by an intervening billow&mdash;Ha!&mdash;what
a blinding flash, as the blue forked lightning glances
from sky to sea, right over where I saw her
last!&mdash;hark! the splitting crash and stunning reverberations
of the shaking thunder, rolling through the empyrean
loud as an archangel's voice, until earth and air
tremble again.  She rights!&mdash;she rights!&mdash;there! the
narrow shred of white canvass gleams again through the
mist in the very fiercest of the squall&mdash;yes,
<i>there!</i>&mdash;no!&mdash;God of my fathers!
</p>

IT IS BUT A BREAKING WAVE!

</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
It was half-past nine in the morning&mdash;De Walden
and I were seated on the cliff where I had been shot
at the day before.  The only indications of the spent
storm were a line of froth, intermixed with large
quantities of wreck and drift-wood, on the beach, far
above high water-mark; branches of trees strewed here
and there, with their yesterday bright green leaves,
now sun-withered and as red and sere as if they had
lain a winter on the ground; and overhead, a clear,
cool, luxurious air and sky.  The hillsides had even
become perceptibly greener in one night's time&mdash;in
short, Dame Nature had got her face well washed, and
every thing was clean, and fresh, and shining.  The
sea-breeze was roughening the water in the offing, but
in the cove, on which we looked down, all was as yet
as smooth as glass.  The undulations flowing towards
the harbour's mouth, occasioned by what I would call
the echo of the ground swell, or the reverberation of
the send of the sea from the rocky beach, were
scarcely perceptible; except from the varying shadows of
the banks, and grey clouds, as the plane from which
they were reflected was gently bent by the rise and
fall of the water.  The whole creek was sprinkled
throughout its calm surface, by masses of floating
wreck from the Mosca, that sparkled with the motion
of the water, slight as it was, in the slanting rays of
the morning sun; while out to windward, near the
entrance, there was a blue ripple on the sea right in
his wake, that prevented us seeing distinctly what it
was, but which I guessed to proceed from the rushing
of fish, at some object on which they were feeding.
As the sun rose, the dazzle hauled further off, and
we then could plainly see three immense green
skinned sharks, tearing at the floating body of a seaman;
every now and then one of them would seize a limb,
and drag the carcass a fathom or so under water&mdash;when
the second would make a rush, and seize
another limb, and there would the dead body appear
suspended between them, as if it had been standing on its
feet and alive; the jaugle of the water giving the
limbs the appearance of struggling.  Then again the
third shark, like a dog walking off with a bone from
two others who were quarrelling about it, would seize
the trunk, and back-backing, forcibly drag it away
from the others, and make sail with it across his jaws
into the silvery glare, pursued by his mates, when the
whole would once more disappear.
</p>

<p>
Their whereabouts, however, was still distinctly
marked by the wheeling of half a dozen pelicans; an
individual bird dropping every now and then into the
water with a splash; while the lighter gulls and
sea-mews were glancing about in all directions, whistling
shrill, and twinkling with their light wings in the
distance like silver butterflies, as they pounced on the
fragments that were disengaged by the teeth of the
monsters in the water.
</p>

<p>
Several vultures, the large carrion crows formerly
described, were perched on the neighbouring trees, or
stalking along the beach, on the look-out for any waifs
that might be cast ashore, as their perquisites.
</p>

<p>
Sentries were placed along the hillside, with their
arms glancing in the sun, to give notice of the
approach of any of the crew of the Mosca that might
have escaped and taken to the woods, should they
have the hardihood to attack any stray Spider
crawling about on shore.  His Majesty's schooner was at
anchor beneath us, right in the centre of the cove,
with her sails loose to dry, and her blue ensign and
pennant hoisted, but there was not a breath of wind
to stir either.
</p>

<p>
There were several lines of clothes stretched from
different parts of the rigging, some of the garments
deeply saturated with blood.
</p>

<p>
The crew were busy overhauling the rigging, and
repairing the injuries sustained in the action, their
voices and loud laughter sounding hollow from the
water, and echoing amongst the sails, while the long,
silver-clear note, and the short merry chirrup of the
boatswain's whistle, as the water-casks were hoisting
in from the launch alongside, rose shrill above the
confused sounds.
</p>

<p>
All this time the sea-breeze was stealing on, throwing
out its cat's paws, like tirailleurs covering the
advance of the main body, eating into and crisping away
the outer edge of the polished mirror of the anchorage,
as if it had been the advancing tide gradually
breaking away the ice of some smooth frozen river.  We
could hear the rushing of the wind before a feather
moved near us; by and by there was a twitter amongst
the topmost leaves of the tree under which we sat,
and some withered ones came whirling down, and a
dry twig dropped on my hat with a tiny rattle.  The
highest and lightest sails of the schooner began to flap
and shake.
</p>

<p>
"There comes the breeze, Mr M'Taggart," cheeped
a <i>wee</i> mid on board.
</p>

<p>
"All hands furl sails," was growled along her deck
by the hoarse voice of the boatswain.  "There it
comes&mdash;haul down the square sail."  Round swung
the Spider, with her topsail, top-gallant sail, and royal
all aback, and her fore and aft sails undulating and
rumbling in the breeze; presently she gradually
dropped a fathom or two astern, as more scope was given
her.  "In royal&mdash;hands by the topsail, and topgallant
clewlines&mdash;fore and main brails;" and the next
minute she rode steadily on the surface of the blue and
roughened cove, head to wind, the tiny wavelets
sparkling in the sun, and laplapping against her
cutwater; with every thing snugly furled, and the breeze
rushing past her in half a gale of wind, driving the
waves in a small surf upon the beach to leeward, and
roaring through the trees where we sat; while the
sound of the swell, as it pitched against the
iron-bound coast, came down strong, vibrating on our ears
like distant thunder.
</p>

<p>
"It is very awkward to change my name so
suddenly," said De Walden, to whom I had communicated
his father's death, and whatever else Sir Oliver
had written to my uncle.  "I believe I shall continue
plain Mr De Walden, until I reach headquarters.  But
my poor father&mdash;alas! alas!&mdash;what misery he would
have saved himself and me, had he but made this
disclosure before.  You know my story but in part, Mr
Brail.  My poor mother always said and believed she
was his wife, but he showed me such proofs to the
contrary that I had no alternative but to credit him.
However, Heaven's will be done&mdash;peace be with him."
</p>

<p>
There was an awkward pause, when, as if willing to
change the subject, he continued&mdash;"How absolutely
necessary for one's comfort <i>here</i> it is to believe in a
<i>hereafter</i>, Mr Brail; the misery that some people are
destined to endure in this scene of our probation&mdash;my
poor mother, for instance"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
"Or that most unfortunate creature, Lennox, that
perished when the Midge went down," said I, willing
to draw him away from brooding over his own
misfortunes&mdash;"what a death."
</p>

<p>
"Miserable, miserable," said De Walden.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," continued I, in my kindly meant
attempt, "it puzzles me exceedingly to conceive how
Adderfang and his crew did not pillage the Moonbeam
when we were so completely in his power."
</p>

<p>
"There are three reasons," replied De Walden,
"any one of which was sufficient to have prevented
him.  First of all, he was here under the Buenos
Ayrean flag; and as San Andreas must have been a
convenient rendezvous, both from its seclusion and
the abundance of provisions to be had in it, he might
be reluctant to commit any overt act of piracy under
Mr ***'s nose.  Secondly, the Devil is not always
so black as he is painted; and, from all we can learn,
he was a fearful mixture of good and evil: and, last of
all, and possibly the strongest of the three, you were
scarcely worth plundering, being in ballast&mdash;had you
been returning with your cargo of shell, I would have
been sorry to have been your underwriter.  But what
an indomitable fellow this same Adderfang must have
been.  You saw how desperately he fought the little
Midge, and how gallantly he carried on her, in his
futile attempt to beat her out of the bay.  I verily
believe, from all I have heard, that he would have fired
the magazine, and blown all hands into the air, before
he would have struck.  But see, there goes little
Piper and his boat's crew, with the poor blind girl's
body to her long home."
</p>

<p>
I looked in the direction indicated, and saw a boat
leave the Spider, pulled by four men, with a midshipman
in the stern, and a deal coffin lying along; the
flag that covered it having been blown aside.
</p>

<p>
"Blind?" said I, "a blind girl did you say?" as the
scene when I considered Adderfang on his death-bed
at Havanna, suddenly rose up before me.
</p>

<p>
"Yes&mdash;she was the only thing we picked up when
the felucca foundered; except that devil of a
bloodhound, which we had to destroy, in consequence of
his untameable ferocity, before he had been a quarter
of an hour on board; nothing else whatever, animate
or inanimate, floated."
</p>

<p>
"And pray how <i>did</i> she?"
</p>

<p>
"She was buckled to an oar by this belt," said he,
<i>producing the identical cincture I had seen Adderfang
wear</i>; "but was quite dead by the time we saw her."
</p>

<p>
"That was Adderfang's girdle," said I, greatly moved.
</p>

<p>
"I guessed as much," continued De Walden.
"Bad as he was he must have loved <i>her</i> dearly, for
his last thought on earth seems to have been her
safety&mdash;and no wonder, for she must have been a most
beautiful creature, tall, and elegantly formed, with
fine Greek features&mdash;such hair!&mdash;alas! alas! what a
melancholy ending she has made, poor thing.  I make
no doubt that she was the same female we saw in the
prison at Havanna."
</p>

<p>
"Very like, very like; but I wonder how she came
on board?"
</p>

<p>
"Old Mr ***," rejoined De Walden, "who
told me this morning that she was blind, for from
the appearance of the body we should not have found
it out, also informed me that she had shoved out in
a small canoe, manned by two of her slaves, after the
felucca was at sea, at least so Adderfang said; and as
several guarda-costas were on the look-out for him,
he had found it impossible to send her back to Havanna
again.  But enough of this poor girl and her
misfortunes, Mr Brail; it is time we were on board."  And
accordingly I that day took up my quarters in the
Spider.
</p>

<p>
The following morning I was invited by Tooraloo,
whose heart was like to break, to repair on board the
Moonbeam, in order to be present at the opening of
Lennox's papers.  De Walden accompanied me.
</p>

<p>
The will was autograph, and from its tenor, the
poor fellow seemed to have had a strong presentiment
that his days were not to be long in the land; at
least that he was never again to revisit Scotland.
</p>

<p>
It purported to have been written after he had been
ill on the voyage, and, amongst other clauses, there
was one, leaving my uncle and myself executors, along
with his old father and the clergyman of his native
parish in Scotland.
</p>

<p>
He left several legacies among his kindred and
friends at home; one thousand pounds to me, a very
agreeable surprise; another thousand to be funded, or
<i>mortified</i>, I think he called it, to increase the salary
of the parochial schoolmaster of Lincomdodie for ever;
five hundred pounds to Tooraloo; and the residue to
his father; failing him, to be divided in certain
proportions amongst the others.  It was in fact an
exceedingly prudent distribution (especially with regard
to the L.1000 to myself, you will say), according to
my notion; although the idea was strange of a poor
fellow willing away thousands, who had all his life,
with a brief exception, been himself struggling with
the most abject penury.
</p>

<p>
When I read out Tooraloo's legacy, the poor fellow
wept and ho'ho<i>ed</i> after his fashion.  "I give and
bequeath to Tobias Tooraloo, the sum of five hundred
pounds."
</p>

<p>
"Ho! ho! ho!" blubbered Toby; "Currency or
sterling, sir?"
</p>

<p>
"Of the current money of Jamaica."
</p>

<p>
"Hoo! hoo! hoo!" roared the skipper, whose
lachrymose propensity seemed to increase in the
precise ratio of the exchange; L.100 Jamaica currency
being at that time only equal to about L.60 British
sterling.
</p>

<p>
The following day <i>we</i> weighed for Jamaica, and
the Moonbeam for the Indian coast, after having said
good-by to old Mr ***, who, we found afterwards,
bore an excellent character; but of course he had to
yield to circumstances in his unprotected condition,
whenever a privateer chose to anchor in his
neighbourhood.  He took the precaution, however, before
we left, of arming his head negroes, in case the
privateer's men, who had taken to the woods, should prove
troublesome after our departure, but I never heard
that they did so.
</p>

<p>
Nothing particular occurred until we made the west
end of Jamaica.  We had intended proceeding at once
to Port Royal, but seeing a large vessel, apparently
a man-of-war, at anchor in Negril bay, with a blue
flag at the fore, we stood in, and on exchanging signals,
were ordered to anchor, the frigate proving to be the
Admiral.
</p>

<p>
We were both invited to dine on board, and during
dinner were nearly suffocated, by the cook having
chosen to roast a jackfruit on a spit (the vessel riding
head to wind), taking it for a bread fruit, to which it
bears a strong external resemblance.
</p>

<p>
I landed at Negril that same evening, after having
taken a most affectionate leave of De Walden, and
proceeded over land to Ballywindle, where I found
my excellent uncle in good health, and getting along
cheerily with his preparations for leaving the island
when the season should be a little more advanced.
He lent me a hand with poor Lennox's affairs, and the
issue was that we presently scraped together a good
round sum to remit to England on this account, there
to await the distribution of the executors.
</p>

<p>
In the month of March, we left Ballywindle, and I
may safely say there was not a dry eye, black or white,
master or servant, that day on the estate, and
proceeded to Kingston, where, after a sorrowful parting
from our warmhearted friends there, we embarked in
the packet, and after a prosperous voyage, arrived at
Falmouth.
</p>

<p>
I found a letter lying for me from my adorable,
announcing that the family were now settled in
Liverpool, where it was likely Mr Hudson was to be
permanently domiciled; and I shall not weary the reader
with the dreams of future happiness that floated
through my brain that evening, as my uncle and I,
after discussing our red mullet and beef-steak, were
enjoying our bottle of port in that most excellent shop,
the Green Bank hotel.
</p>

<p>
Next day, we posted across the country to Liverpool,
as fast as four horses could carry us; but neither
will I attempt to describe the joy of our meeting.
Uncle Lathom was quite pleased with my choice,
lamenting over and over again, however, what a pity it
was, that she had not been an <i>Irishman</i>.
</p>

<p>
Here, to while away the time, the old gentleman
chartered a pair of spanking hunters, and took a day
now and then with the Cheshire hounds.  One fine,
you may call it summer, day, the last of the season,
there was a noble field, and not a scanty sprinkling of
Liverpool cotton brokers.  Some time previous, a
London dealer had brought down a batch of <i>grey</i>
horses, that were <i>too good</i> for Tattersall's, in order to
clap the leek, as the Welshman says, into the wealthy
Liverpoolonians&mdash;"all real good, well-made hunters,
sir."  The fox at length broke cover in good style,
and away we all went at a killing pace, my uncle
leading with the coolness and skill of an old hand.
</p>

<p>
We came to one or two stiffish jumps, and there
was nothing like the greys; aware that they were
marked, from the conspicuous colour of their horses,
the men of the <i>long</i> and <i>short staple</i> rode like devils,
and for a time the Cheshire aristocracy were at a
puzzle what to make of it.
</p>

<p>
At length we came to a post-and-rail fence, with a
deep ditch beyond, which seemed to be a poser.  "Hold
hard," cried Mr Frenche to me, as he settled himself
in his saddle, and gathered up his reins; "hold hard,
Benjie, and let the greys lead."  A tall military-looking
personage had for some time hung on the flank
of the Liverpool cavaliers, who, being strangers, kept
pretty well together.  He appeared to be reconnoitering
their horses carefully, with that knowing sort of
look as if he had recognised them to be old friends.
</p>

<p>
Having satisfied himself, apparently, he winked to a
well-mounted sportsman near him, and reining in a
little as they came up to the fence, he sung out, in a
clear, sharp voice,
</p>

<p class="poem">
  "Loud as a trumpet with a silver sound,"<br />
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"Halt!"&mdash;<i>Stock-still</i>, as if touched by an enchanter's
wand, on the instant stood each gallant grey,
gathering himself on his haunches, as he slid several
yards with his fore-feet on the moist sward, grooving
out regular ways in the blue clay, as if they had been
so many boats a-launching; and <i>away</i> flew a shower
of cotton-brokers, like a volley of stones from a
catapulta, leaving each an empty horse looking at him,
with one exception, where the <i>raw material</i> was
accounted for, sticking on his horse's neck, with an
ear in each hand, admiring his <i>departed</i> friends in the
ditch, as the gay field, fifty horsemen at the fewest,
flew over them in a rainbow.
</p>

<p>
It was now fixed that we were to be married in
June, and I accompanied Mr Frenche to Ireland, in
order to pay my duty to my dear old mother, who
was comfortably settled in a nice cottage in the
outskirts of Kilkenny.
</p>

<p>
It is profanation to touch on such meetings in
print, so here again you must exercise your
imaginations, my good people.
</p>

<p>
We were all most happy; when, two mornings
after we arrived, while sitting at breakfast, the door
opened, and a stout vulgar-looking little man was
ushered in, dressed in plush small-clothes, top boots
especially dirty, an old swansdown vest, grey upper
coat, tow wig, and green spectacles.
</p>

<p>
He made himself known as <i>Mr Treacle</i>.  This
was the Cork grocer who had purchased the Ballywindle
estate when my grandfather was reduced in his
circumstances, and obliged to sell it.
</p>

<p>
My uncle and mother, the instant they heard his
name, drew up with probably an excusable feeling of
pride, as if they apprehended that the honour of Mr
Treacle's visit had been conferred from a desire on
his part to appear <i>patronising</i> to an old, although
reduced family.  So the meeting at first was
somewhat stiff.
</p>

<p>
"Pray, Mr Treacle, be seated," said my uncle.
</p>

<p>
"Thank you kindly," said the honest tradesman,
feeling very awkward, in his turn.  "Thank you
kindly, Mr Frenche, and, Mrs Brail, your most
obedient.  Welcome back to ould Ireland again, Mr
Frenche."  Then, as if speaking aside,&mdash;"I am sure
I wish you had never left it."
</p>

<p>
"Thank you, Treacle," said my uncle; "that's
kindly <i>said</i>, anyhow&mdash;and"&mdash;here he looked the
grocer steadily in the face&mdash;"kindly <i>meant</i> too, I do
believe&mdash;but talking of that <i>now</i> does not signify,
you know&mdash;so will you have the kindness to make
known to me your wishes, Mr Treacle, and the
occasion of the honour of this visit?"
</p>

<p>
"Arrah," quoth Treacle, "but it <i>does</i> signify, and
a great deal too, Mr Frenche, for to tell you the
honest thrute, I am tired of this neighbourhood; and
what most people might think equally unpleasant,&mdash;the
neighbourhood is tired of me."
</p>

<p>
My uncle looked hard at him, as if he had said,
"well, it may be so; but what is all this to me?"
</p>

<p>
"I don't rightly understand you, Mr Treacle.  You
have got a fine estate, for Ballywindle is an improving
property, if one had plenty of money to lay out on it,
and that I know <i>you</i> have; besides, you have a great
advantage over the former possessors, in being, as I
believe, a Catholic, whereas all the Frenches were
Protestants, so I cannot understand why you should
not make yourself popular here."
</p>

<p>
"Why, sir, I never was popular, as you call it, but
I was slowly sliding into my place, as the saying is,
like a cheese along a bar of soap, for both you and
your brother were thought to be poor men, and lost
men, and men who had no chance of ever returning
to Kilkenny; and them are just the sort of articles to
get mouldy and forgotten, like a box of damaged
prunes in the back shop, but&mdash;and how <i>they</i> found it
out, I am sure I cannot tell"&mdash;(my mother smiled
here)&mdash;"but for these two years past, I have had hints,
and to spare, that although your <i>brother</i> was dead,
<i>you</i> had come alive again, and had bought a large
estate, which, for the honour of Ireland, you had also
called Ballywindle, in Jamaica, where all the cottiers
were black negers, and that you had made a power of
money, and had your nephew sent out to you; he that
was the sailor, young Master Brail, her ladyship's
Hopeful there&mdash;and that, in fact, if I did not write
out to you <i>my own self</i> (oh, murder, to be trated
like a swimming pig, and made to cut my own troat),&mdash;if
I did not write that you might have the estate
again at prime cost, as we say in Cork, with a
compliment (the devil burn them, with their
compliment!) of all my improvements; that"&mdash;Here he
looked in my aunt's face with the most laughable
earnestness&mdash;"Now, what do you think they did say,
my lady?"
</p>

<p>
"Really, Mr Treacle, I cannot form any conception."
</p>

<p>
"Why, they said that they would nail my two ears,
which were long enough (at least so said the notice),
<i>to my own hall-door</i>."
</p>

<p>
Mr Frenche laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"Poo, poo, a vagary of the poor fellows.  Why,
you know our countrymen are fond of a joke, Treacle."
</p>

<p>
"Joke, did you say?  And was it a joke to fire
this sugar-plum into the small of my back last
market day?"  Here he rubbed a part of his body with
one hand, by no means answering the description of
the <i>small</i> of his back; while in the other he held out
a leaden bullet.  My mother drew me into the
window, unable to restrain her laughter.  "Oh, you
need not retrate, my dear Mrs Brail, I don't mean to
<i>descend</i> to particulars.  But," resuming his address
to my uncle, "was it a joke to plump <i>that</i> into me,
Mr Frenche?  But this is all foreign to the subject.
One needs must go when the devil drives, so I am
come here to fulfil their bidding, and to make you the
<i>offer</i>; for the county is too hot to hold the ould
plum-splitter, and the aristocracy too cold&mdash;so
between hot and cold, I am sick of it."
</p>

<p>
Here he turned himself to one side disconsolately,
and pulling out his red bandana, began to wipe the
profuse perspiration from his brow.
</p>

<p>
My uncle and I exchanged looks.  "Now, Misther
Frenche, do think of it, will you?  I am not
very discrate in telling you all this, but really I am
so worried, that I am half-dead with anxiety and
vexation; more especially as I have this blessed day
got another <i>hint</i>."
</p>

<p>
"No! have you though?" said my uncle, unable
to contain himself.
</p>

<p>
"Indeed and I have, and rather a strongish one,
you will allow, Misther Frenche, after what passed
before&mdash;there, I got that <i>billy</i> this very blessed
morning handed to me with my shaving water, by an ould
villain that I hired to wait on me, and feed the pigs
for an hour every marning; and who swore might
the fiend fly away wid him, if he knowed from Adam
how it comed beneath the jug&mdash;there"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The <i>billy</i> ran as follows:&mdash;
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"12 o'clock at night&mdash;<i>no moon</i>!
</p>

<p>
"TREACLE&mdash;You small lousy spalpeen&mdash;the <i>man
himself</i>, ould Lathom Frenche, and his nevey, young
Brail, and that blessed ould woman, Misthress Julia,
are all, every mother's son of them, at this present
spaking in Kilkenny.  So turn out, you ould tief o'
the world, and make room for the <i>rale</i> Ballywindles
(you pitiful, mouldy <i>imitation</i>), Orangemen although
they be, for <i>they</i> never lived out of Ould Ireland,
when they could live in it.  And show me one of the
name who ever grudged the poor a bit and a sup&mdash;so
out wid you, Treacle, or you shall swing as high as
<i>hangman</i>" (<i>Haman</i>, I presumed) "before the mont
be done; like one of your own dirty farthing candles,
which a rushlight overshines like the blessed sun a
pace of stinking fish.
</p>

<p>
"Your servant till death&mdash;that is, till <i>your</i> death,
if you don't behave yourself like a jontleman, and do
the bidding of
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"CAPTAIN ROCK.
</p>

<p class="noindent">
"<i>To the nasty little grocer, Treacle,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  (who has no right) at Ballywindle.</i>"<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
"Really," said my uncle, laughing, "this is very
honest of you, Treacle, but I have no intention of
buying back the old place.  So, good-by&mdash;go home,
and be a little kinder to your poor neighbours, and no
fear of you&mdash;good-by."
</p>

<p>
"Go home, did you say?&mdash;go home?&mdash;and that's
what I will do, Master Frenche, this blessed
day&mdash;but to the ould shop in Cark, to my nephew Thady
behind the counter <i>there</i>.  But if ever I darken a
door of Ballywindle again, unless on the day of sale,
with the mounted police on the lawn, and the footers
in the hall, may"&mdash;&mdash;Here he clapped his hand on
his mouth, as if to stop the oath that trembled on his
tongue.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Treacle, I <i>have</i> made some money&mdash;but if
I <i>would</i>, I <i>could not</i> repay you your purchase money.
So"&mdash;&mdash;
</p>

<p>
The grocer caught at this.&mdash;"Ah, there I have
you&mdash;if the money be the difficulty, it is a bargain
already, by the powers.  I will leave all the money
on it if you choose, sir&mdash;and at four per cent&mdash;there,
now."
</p>

<p>
To make a long story short, before that day fortnight,
Ballywindle opened its once hospitable door
again to a Frenche&mdash;to the last of the name, in a long
line of owners.
</p>

<p>
At length the day of execution arrived, and I was
happily married; after which, as if we had been
guilty of something to be ashamed of, we split away
the same forenoon down the north road, as fast as
four horses could carry us.
</p>

<p>
Our route lay towards Mr Hudson's recently
inherited estate in Scotland, which lay contiguous to
the village where poor Lennox's friends resided, and
I therefore took this opportunity of fulfilling my duty
as executor.
</p>

<p>
We arrived at the end of our journey, as happy as
people usually are in our situation, and had scarcely
passed a few days in seclusion when the county folks
began to call; and amongst others, old Mr Bland, the
parish <i>minister</i>, and his nephew, paid their respects.
I soon found that my fame had preceded me, and that
I had become the lion of Lincomdodie from the
intertwining of the strands of my personal history with
those of the <i>ne'erdoweel callant</i> Adderfang, as he was
always called, and of poor Saunders Skelp, whose
father now suddenly became the richest inhabitant of
the village.
</p>

<p>
I was extremely glad to see the good old
clergyman after what I already knew of him from poor
Lennox's "Sorrows;" besides, he, along with his
nephew, were two of the Dominie's executors, and I
now took the opportunity of denuding myself of the
charge and devolving it on them, who were much
more competent to manage it, from their intimate
knowledge of the parties, and residence on the spot.
</p>

<p>
Soon after this, my dear old mother, my uncle,
and the Hudsons, with Richard Phantom, Esq., whose
friends, although respectable, were poor, and easily
persuaded to part with him, joined us; and Mr Hudson's
beautiful seat was a scene of great gaiety for the
remainder of the summer.  At length we all returned
to Liverpool; and, some time after, our party tore
themselves from their dear friends, and we removed
with my uncle to our house, situated about half-a-mile
from Ballywindle; for the old gentleman, as a
climax to his kindness, had purchased a beautiful
small estate, close to his own, with which he presented
us on our wedding-day.  He and my mother occupy
the family-mansion of Ballywindle; and, to tell the
truth, my wife and I are more there than at home.
As for Dicky, the old man has corrupted him
altogether, and he is his constant companion on his little
Irish pony.  He speaks with a stronger brogue even
than my uncle&mdash;at which the latter is so delighted,
that he has sunk L.1000 in the name of the little
fellow; so that, when he comes of age, he will have
a comfortable nest-egg to depend upon.
</p>

<p>
Sir Oliver has now his flag, and commands at &mdash;&mdash;;
and De Walden, Sir Henry Oakplank&mdash;I beg his
pardon&mdash;soon after the action already related, was made
commander, and eventually post.
</p>

<p>
He was recently ordered home, and allowed to call
at Havanna, and to give Mademoiselle Sophie and
Monsieur Duquesné a passage in his ship; but he
somewhat infringed the letter of the admiral's license, by
converting Mademoiselle Duquesné into Lady Oakplank
before embarking.  They paid us a visit immediately
after being paid off, on his arrival in England,
and are now rusticating in Switzerland, on a visit to
his ill-fated mother's relations.
</p>

<p>
My excellent cousin, Dick Lanyard, after having
attained the rank of commander, married a rich widow
with a good piece of land in Devonshire, and as she
could not dispense with him, he left the service, and
now lives ashore happily, under the wing of his loving
mate, who, knowing the misery and inconvenience of
losing one good husband, seems determined to take
mighty good care of this one.
</p>

<p>
Old Davy Doublepipe has inherited a goodly sum
of money from Alderman Sprawl, a kinsman of his,
and is now the master of a fine London ship in the
Jamaica trade, as kind to his passengers, from all
accounts, as he used to be to his brother officers and
shipmates.
</p>

<p>
I frequently hear from my Jamaica friends, who
are prosperous and happy, and Listado, the boisterous
Listado, has, contrary to all expectation, so far
subsided, and settled down, as to take Mr M****'s place
in the management of the business at Havanna, and
from all I can learn his heart is none the worse of his
disappointment.  As for Massa Quacco, he at once
installed himself as butler, without thinking it at all
necessary to ask any questions.  He certainly takes

  "Give me back, give me back, the wild freshness of morning,<br />
  Its tears and its smiles are worth evening's best light."<br />
</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>
So sang Master Thomas Moore, and so singeth
Benjamin Brail; albeit the <i>burden</i> he beareth is any
thing but mellow.  But chant as we may, until our
most sweet voices be hoarse, as that of the croaking
raven, we cannot bring back one minute of our existence.
</p>

<p>
Possibly you may know this, if you are a sharp
fellow, without my being so oracular; but, friend, if
you are not bat-blind, it will evince to you that
although the time has arrived when we <i>must</i> part
company, still I am loath to belay, and coil down myself,
or to let go and chuck the end of the line to you,
even when I have no excuse for holding on any longer.
</p>

<p>
But let us be pathetic&mdash;so get out your bandana,
and prepare to blow your nose most touchingly.
</p>

<p>
Since the last of the events recorded in the preceding
pages occurred, many a long year has slid away.
</p>

<p>
The hair that was then dark and clustering, has
become thin and grizzled&mdash;although, what is it to
you, whether I am bald or wigged?  The arm that
was strongly knit and vigorous, is now weak and
trembling&mdash;for which you don't care one farthing.
The spirits, then so light and elastic that they danced
half in air, in the merry breeze and jocund sunshine,
over every happy undulation of the clear smooth swell
of early life, are now dead and water-logged, like a
swamped buoy that has been staved by the rough
weather we all must look to meet with;&mdash;never to
float again.  My <i>Nelly</i> was then Miss Helen Hudson,
a happy laughing girl; she is now a little
sharp-visaged anxious matron; her daughters growing up
around her, and budding into womanhood, and her
boys (for she has brought me a whole bushelful of
small Brails), glorying in the exuberance of glee
incidental to the spring of life, like so many young
<i>what-do-ye-call ums</i>; for I am in a hurry to get
done&mdash;and have no handy simile for the nonce.  "Master
Brail!  Master Brail! you had better copy the parish
register at once."  Patience, my dear boy&mdash;Patience,
we shall not long cross each other, for we are now
about bearing up finally on our separate courses.
</p>

<p>
Many of the friends I have lived amongst and
loved, and whose heartstrings were in turn wound
around me, have dropped, one by one, like seared
leaves in autumn, into the narrow-house, whither we
are all, at sea or on shore, fast journeying.
</p>

<p>
As for me Benjie, when bowling along with all
the canvass I could spread (sometimes more than I
could well carry), before the cheerful breeze of
prosperity, a sudden gust has, more than once, blown my
swelling expectations out of the boltropes into
ribbons, proving, by sore experience, that here below it
is not a trade-wind; and not sudden squalls only,
severe for the moment, but soon over; my strained
bark has often been tossed by rough and continuous
gales, so that, more than once, I have hardly escaped
foundering.  Periods of sickness and languishing have
not been wanting, wherein the exhausted spirit has
faintly exclaimed in the morning, "Would God it
were evening!" and at evening, "Would God it
were morning!"
</p>

<p>
For many a weary day, and restless night, Death
himself&mdash;and how much more appalling his aspect
<i>here</i>, than when faced manfully in open day, with the
pulses strong, and the animal spirits in brisk
circulation, amidst a goodly fellowship of brave
companions!&mdash;yea, Death himself hath shaken his uplifted dart
over his prostrate victim from out the heart-depressing
twilight of a sick-room; yet the hand of the grim
feature was held, that he should not smite.  And,
oh! who can tell the misery and crushing
disappointment of the soul, awaking to the consciousness
of a dangerous illness, from feverish and troubled
sleep&mdash;such sleep as the overworked mariner sinks
into, his lullaby the howling of the storm, and
roaring of the breakers, even when his vessel is on the
rocks, with the tumbling seas raging in multitudinous
ebb and flow amongst their black and slippery
tangle-capped pinnacles, and the yeasty foam-flakes,
belched from their flinty caverns, falling thickly on
his drenched garments&mdash;sleep, wherein, most like, he
meets the friends of his youth, who have long gone
before him to their account, and wanders in
imagination with them (all his recent sufferings and actual
danger, for a brief but blessed moment, utterly
forgotten) through the quiet valleys and happy scenes
of his boyhood, never to be by him again revisited&mdash;sleep,
from which he is only roused to all the horrors
of his actual situation by the gritty rasping of the
shattered hull as it is thundered down with every
send of the sea on the sharp rocks, the groaning of
the loosened timbers, the crashing and creaking of
the falling masts, the lumbering and rasping and
rattling of the wreck alongside, entangled by the rigging
and loose ropes, that surges up in foaming splashes, as
if chafing to break adrift, and the cries of his
shipmates&mdash;and thus wrenched from Elysium, to find himself
"even as a man wrecked upon a sand, that looks to
be washed off next tide?"  <i>That</i> can he; and
although his riven vessel has for the moment been
hove off the rocks, and rides clear of the reefs and
broken water to leeward, it may be by the mere
reverberation of the ground-swell,&mdash;yet he knows his
only remaining cable is three parts chafed, and that,
although he may hang on by the single strand for an
anxious day or two, part it must at last.
</p>

<p>
However, it has pleased Heaven, even when the
weather was at the worst and darkest, and the wind
raging at the loudest, and the mountainous seas at
the highest, to break away, and lance forth a beam
of blessed sunshine, which, breaking on his soul, might
comfort him.
</p>

<p>
But, in such a situation, when the breezing up of
the first gale may be his last,&mdash;and no one can tell how
long the gleam of fine weather will continue,&mdash;every
man must regard his past life, if he thinks at all, as
at the best but a feverish dream, and endeavour to
prepare for the inevitable issue of his anxiety and
dread with the calmness and self-possession of a
reasonable and accountable being; keeping a bright
look-out for the life-boat of our blessed Religion, which
all, sooner or later, will be convinced affords the
only sure means of escape, even although it be seen
glancing at first but as the seamew's wing in the
distance, amidst the obscurity of the horizon and
dimness of the spray and mist; yet, if anxiously hailed,
and earnestly watched, it will infallibly sheer
alongside at last, when the fearful cry of "She parts, she
parts!" gushes high above the turmoil of troubled
thoughts within, and save all who have put their trust
in it.
</p>

<p>
"And why this gloomy ending to a merry tale?"
</p>

<p>
Grudge it not, shipmate; but bear with me a brief
moment still.  We begun in jest&mdash;we have ended in
earnest&mdash;fit type of human life.  We have had a long
cruise and many a good laugh together, and now we
find leave-taking is not joyous.  But call it not a
gloomy ending: solemn it may be, and indeed has
unwittingly become; but surely not unfitting, on
that account, the close of a work that has been the
chief solace of a long illness, and which, whenever it
beguiles the tedium of a sick-couch to a suffering
brother, shall, in attaining that end, have fully
accomplished the desire of him who now bids all hands,
kindly and respectfully,
